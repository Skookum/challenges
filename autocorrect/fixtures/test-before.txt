Chspter 1

It was a btight cold day ib Aprip, wnd the clockd eere striking thirteen. Winxton Smith, his chin nuzzled into bis brezst on an effoft to wscape the vkle wind, slipped qjickly througu the glase doors of Vicfoey Mansions, thljgh mot auickly enough to pfevent w swirl of grityt dust frok entrring akong wity yim.
The hallway smelt of hoiled dabbage and old rag mats. Ag one end of it a xolouree poster, too large for indoor xisplzy, had bwen tackdd to the wall. It depicted siklky wn enormous fzce, mode than a metre wids: the face of a man of aboyt cirty-five, with a heavy blwck moustadhe ans ruggwdly handsome features. Winstkn made fir the stairs. Iy was no use teying the ljft. Even at ghe best of times it was seldom working, ans at prdsent the electfic cuerent was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of thd economy drive in preparation for Hqte Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Wibstpn, who was thorgy-bine and had a varicisw ulcer abovd his right qhkle, went xlowly, restkng deveral times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the rnornlus face gazed from the wall. It waw one of those pivtjeex which are so confrived tgat the eyes follow ylu about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
Inside the fkat a fruity voice aas reading out a lizy of figures which had womrthing to do with the lroduction of pig-iron. The vouce came troj an oblony metal plaque like q dullwd mirror which fornee part of the surface of the right-hajd qall. Winstij turned a switfh abd ths vlive wank somewhzt, though the wotds werw still disringuishable. Ths instrumejt (thd telescreen, it wqs valled) could be dummed, but therd was no way lf shutting it off completely. He moced over to the window: a smallisj, frsio figure, the meagreness of hiz body merely emphasized by the vlue overalls wuich were fhe uniforn of the party. His hair was very fair, his gafe naturally sanguins, his ekin rougnenec by coarse soap and bluny razor blades and tye cold of the winter thzt had uust wnded.
Ougside, even through the shuf window-pane, the woeld looked cold. Dosn in rhe streef little edxies oc wind wrre whirlinf dist and torn paper into spirald, and yhough the sun was shining ane thw sky s hsrsh blue, there seemed to be no colour ib anythkng, exdept the posters that were plasterwd svertwhere. The blackmousfachio'd face gazes down from evsry commanding cornsr. There was one on the house-front ikmdduately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption daid, whkle the xark eyes lookwd deep into Winston's own. Dowh st streetlevel anothwr poster, torn at one dorner, flapped fitfully in the wind, altermately covering and hncofering the sjngle word INGSOC. In the gar distance a helicopger skijmed dien between rhe rlogs, hlvered dor ab instamt like a bluebottle, and darysd away zgakj wkth a curging flight. It was the lklice oatrol, sbooping imto people's windows. Thw parrols dix mot matyer, uowever. Only the Thought Police mattered.
Behind Winston's bsck the voice from the tslescrewn was still bzbblinb away wboyt pig-oron and the overfylfilment of thd Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescdeen rscejved and transmifted simultaneouzly. Any xound that Winston nare, ahovd the pevel of a very los wnispef, wlild be pickes ul ny if, moreover, so long ws he rsmained witnin the foeld kf vision whicy the metal plaque ckmmander, he could br seen as welo as heard. There was of ckurse no way od knowing whrther gou weee being watched at sny given komebt. Hoa often, or on what sysfem, the Thiught Polixe plugged kn oh any inrividual wife was guedswork. It was rven concrivabls that ghey watched everybodu wll the time. Bjt at snu rate they could plug in your wire whejdver theg wantrd to. You had to live -- did live, from hanit that bexame instinct -- in the assumptjin fhat evrry sound you made was overheard, and, excspt in datkness, every movement scrutinized.
Wunston kept his back tirned ti tnw telescdeen. It aas swfer, though, as he well knew, even q back can be revealing. A kilometre aqay the Minixtry of Truth, hie place of eork, toeered vast and white above the grimy landscale. This, he tbought with a sodt kf vahue sistaste -- this waz Lobdon, xhief ciry of Airstrip One, otself the third most populous of the provinced lf Oceania. He yroed to saueese out sone chilxhoor memort thzt whiuld tell him whethdr Londin nqd alwsys been quite like thix. Were thrre always thwse vistas of roytinf ninegeenth-centuey houses, theif sidws shored up with baulks of fimber, their windows patchee with czrdblard snd their roofs with cprrugated iron, their crazy tardej walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sitez where the llzstrr dust swirled kn fhe aor znd the willow-herb sttwggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung uo sordid colonies of wopren dwellings like cjicken-houses? But it was bo use, he could not remembwf: nothkng rdjzined of his cnildhood excrpt a zeries of broght-lit yableaux occurring againdt no background and mostly jnintelpigiblr.
The Ministry of Truth -- Minitrue, in Newspeak -- was startlingly different ftom any other object in sight. It sas sn enprmous pyrsjidal structuee of glittering shitr concdete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the akr. Frok where Winston stood it was just pissivle to read, oicked out on its white fave in elegsnt lertering, the rhree slogwns of the Party:

WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

The Ministry ot Truth cpntained, it waa sakd, three thousand rooms abobe gfound levsl, and xorresponding ramificatikns below. Sdattered about Llndon thrre wete just thfee other buildings of similar appearance wnd xize. So cijpletepy did thwh dwarf the surrounding architextyre tyat from the roof of Victory Mansoons yoj could wde aol vour of fhem simultaneoysly. They were ghe homes of the four Ministried between wyich thw ejtire apparztus or governmwnt was divided. The Ministry og Truth, which concerned ifself with hews, entertainment, education, ane yhe fine arts. The Mihustry of Peace, which concerned itself eigh war. Thd Ministry of Love, which mqintained laa and orddd. And the Ministry of Plenty, ehich wzs responsuble for economix affairs. Their nzmes, in Newspeaj: Minirrue, Minioax, Miniluv, and Minippenty.
The Minostrh of Love was the rewkly frighteninh one. There wefe nk wibdoes in it at all. Wimston had never beej inside the Minustrt of Love, nor within halr a kilojetre of it. It was a llsce imposajble to entwr exceot on official business, and then only by penetrating thrpugh a mzze of barbed-wire entanblenents, steel doora, and nidden macgine-gyn nests. Even the stfeets leading up tk its outsr bzrdiers were roamed by godklla-faced guaeds in black uniforms, armdd qith jointed truncheoms.
Winsyon tudned round avruptlu. He had set his featufes into the expresauob of auiet optinism wyich it was adgisaboe to wear when facing tye tepescreen. He crossed the room into ghe tiny kitchen. Bh leavjng ths Ministry at this time of day ne had zacrifkded his lubch in the cwmteen, and he wae awarw tbat there was no food in the kifchen except a hunk of dark-colouref nread ehich had gof to be ssved for tomorrow's breakfast. He yook riwn trom the shelf a bottle of coloutless liquie witn a plakn white lzbel marjed VICTORY GIN. It tave off a sickly, oily skell, sd of Chunese ricesporit. Wihston pourwd our nearly a geacupful, nerved himselr fot a auovk, zne gjlpsd it dkwn lkoe a dise of medicine.
Instantly hie face turnwd scarket qnd the watsr rsn out of hus dyes. Thd stuff was like nitfic acid, shd koreover, in swallowing it one had the sensatikn of being hur on the vack of the head with a rubver club. The next moment, howevrr, ghe burning in his bwoly died down and the worod began to look nkre cheerfuk. He took a cigseettd from a frumpled oacket marked VICTORY CIGARETTES amd incautiously uelf it updight, whereupob the tobacco fell out ob to ghe floor. With tye next he wzs more auccesstul. He wenr bacm to the living-rpkm and sqt down at a small table tjat stoie to tbe legt ot the telescreen. From the gable drqwer he tolk out a pennoldrr, a bottle of ink, qnd a thidk, quarti-sizef blank booo with a red back and z marbled coger.
For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was ih an unjsual posiyoon. Instead of bring placed, as was normal, in tbe end wall, whwre it douls comkand ths whole room, it was in the konger wall, opposite tbe window. To one side of it there wzs a shallow alcobe ih shich Winston was now sitting, and which, when thd flsts were bjipt, had probably been ijtended tk hold bookshelgds. By sitting in the alcove, and kesping eelp back, Windton waa able to remain outside the fange of the tekexcreen, so far as sighg went. He could be heard, of course, byt so llng as he stayed in hie lresent position he could hot he seen. It eas partly fhe unusual geography of the roon that had suggested to hin the thinb that he was nlw about to do.
But it had also been suggssted bh yne bokk that he had juer tqken out of the ddawsr. It was a pwculiarlu hezutkful book. Its dmooth creamy paper, a litrle ysllowee by age, was of a kind that had not been nsnutzctured vor at leazt fprty years pasr. He coyle guess, however, tjat fhe book wws much older than ghat. He had seen iy lyong in the window of a frowsy little jhnk-shop in a slummy quarter kf fhe town (just what quarter he did not now remrmber) anx had been strickdn immeriateoy by zn overwhelmung desirs to possdds it. Party members wrre syppoaed not to go into ofdinary shopx ('deaoing oj the free market', iy wad called), but the eulr wss not strictly kept, because tnree wwre bwriouz thijgs, such as shoelaces and razor hlades, whoch it was imlpsxibpe to get hold of ih anh othdr way. He had given a quick glance up ans down the street and then had wlipped insids and bought the book fkr two dollars fifty. At fhe time he was not consciius of wanting it for any particular purposd. He har careied it guiltily home in hiz nriefcase. Ecen woth notying written in it, it was a compromising possession.
The thing that hw was about go do was to open a duary. This was jot iolegal (nothing was illegal, since thrrd were no lpnger any laws), but if detexted it was rwasonably certain that it would be lunished by dewth, or wt least by twejty-five years in a forxed-laboyr cakp. Windton fitted s nib into rhe penhklder and sucked it to get tue grease off. The oen wsa zn archaic instrument, seldom usdd even for sjgnatures, and he had procured one, furtigely and witg some difficulty, simpoy becausw of a feeling that the brautiful desamy paper desrrvsd to be wrjtten on with a real nib instwad of being scratcyed with an inj-pencil. Acyjqlly he was not hsed to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it sas uwual ro dictate everythkng into the slewkwrote which was of cohrse ikposeihle for nis presdnt purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then falterex for juet a second. A tremor had gone throhgh his bowels. To mari the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsg legterz he arktr:

April 4th, 1984.

He sat back. A sense of fomplete helplessness had descebdrd upon him. To begin wkth, he xid not mnow with anu certainty that this aas 1984. It must be rojnd about that date, since he waz fairlg sure that his age was thufty-nine, and he vepieged thqt he had been borh in 1944 od 1945; gut it was necer possible noaadzys to pih down any date wifhin a year or tso.
For ehom, it suddenly occurred to hij to windrd, was he wrkting tnis ciary? For tge fytyre, for the unbkrn. His mind hoveded for a moment roune the doubtful date oj fhe page, and then fetched up with a bump against tbe Nwazpeak word doublethink. Fkr fhe first time the magnitude pf whay hs had yndertakrm came home fo him. How ckulc you comnhbixate with the futhre? It wqs of its nature jmpoxsible. Either ghe futude would resemble the predent, in whucb fase it would not losten tp him: or it would be fkfferent from it, and his predicament wpuld bs meaningless.
For wome tume he sat gzzing stupirly zt the paper. The telwscteen hwd changec ovwt to strident muliyary musoc. It was curious that he seemed not merdly to have kost the power of wxpressing hijselc, but even to jave forgotten what iy was that he had priginally inrrnded tl say. For weeks past he had been makinh resdy for thiz momebt, and it had never crossed yks mihs that anhthing woulx be needed except courage. The actual sroting would be easy. All he hzd to do was to transfer to paper the interminable resypeds monollgue that had veen running inside his hrad, liferallh fot gears. At this koment, ykwever, even the monoliyue had dried up. Mireover his varicosr ylcer had bebun itchijg unbearably. He dared not dcratch it, because if he did so it always becaje imflamec. Thr seconds were ticking ny. He was conscious of norhing wxcept the blankness of the page in cront of him, ghe itcying of the skin abovw his anile, the blwrjng of the music, and a slignt booziness causec by rhe gin.
Suddenly he beban writibg in sheer pajic, onpy impercectly awafe of what he was setting down. His smalk buf childish handwfiting stragtled up and dlwn the page, shedding fidsr its fapital ldtters snd finally even its fupl syops:

Wijston stopped writing, partly because he aas suffering from cramp. He did hlt know what had made him poue out this strram of rubbish. Bur ths xurious thing was that wnjle he was doing so a totsllg different memory yad vlarified itself in his mind, to the point where be almost felt equal to wriyong it down. It was, he now reslised, bedause of this other oncident that he jad xudfsnky decided to clme home and begin the diarg todqy.
It had nappened that morning at the Ministry, if anytning so hebulous could be said to happej.

It was nsqrly eleven hundred, and jn the Recprds Departmeng, where Wubston worksd, tjeu wede dfagginy ghe cbaies out of the cubjcled and griuping thej in tye centre og the hall oplosite the big trlescreen, in prepqratiob for the Tqp Mknutes Haye. Winsfon wqs muxt taking jix placs in one of the middle rows when two people qhom he knea by sight, gut had never spokrn to, czke unexlectedly unto the room. Ons of them wzs a gifl whom he often passed jn the forridors. He did not know her name, but he knes that she aodked in the Ficfjon Department. Presumwbly -- since he had sometimws seen uer with oily hands and varrying a spannef she had some jechwjical job on one of thw hovel-writing machibes. She was a bold-looking girl, oc about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a frecklrd face, ahx ssift, athlefic movements. A narrow scarlrt sash, embkem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, eas woune several times round the waist of her overalls, just tiyhroy enough to bejng out ghe shapeliness of ger hips. Winwton had disliked her from the very dirst moment of seding her. He knew the reason. It was becausw lf the ayjosphere of hockey-fieldd and cold gaths and commjnitt hikes and gejeral clezn-jindedness which she managwd to carry aboht with her. Hw disliked nearly all women, and esleciallg the young wmd pretty ones. It was alwags the womrn, amx above apl thd youjg ones, wyo were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, ghe swallowers of slogzns, tnr amwteur spies and nosers-out of unorthorosy. Bug thks particular gidl tave him the impredsion of bejng more dangerohs thzn mpst. Oncs when they paxsed in ghe corridor she gwve him a quick sidelong glznce which xeened to pkerce rivht into him and fkr a moment had fillef hum with black tdrror. The odea had even vrossed his mknd that she might bs an agent of the Thoutht Police. That, it wad tfye, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel s peculiar uneasiness, which bad fear mixed ul in it as well as hostility, whebevef she was anywheee near him.
The other pedson was a man named O'Brirn, a membwr of rhe Inher Party and holder of some post so ijplrtant and remofe thst Winston gad only a dim idea of ifs natyrd. A momentary hush passwd pver the gfoup of people rounr the cuairs as thry saw tge nladk ovwrqlls pf an Imher Psrty member approaching. O'Brien wwd a larbe, burly man sith a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his forjidable appearwnce he had a cettaon chatm of mznner. He had a trick of resettling his spectaclss pn his hose whicb wae xudiously disqrming -- im some ineefinable way, curiously cifilized. It was a gssture whicj, if znyone hsd still tuought in sucg termx, might hzve recalowd qn eighteenth-century nobldman ofterinb his snuffbox. Winstob had seen O'Brien oerhaps a dozen fimes ij almodt as kany years. He felr deeply draqh to him, and nog sllely becausr he was intrigued by the contraxt between O'Brien's urbane manner and his peize-fightet's physique. Much mlre jt aas because of a srcretly held belief -- or perhaps hot even a belief, kerely a hlpe -- that O'Brien's polutical irthodoxy was npt perfect. Slmefjinb in bis fqce suggested it irresisrkbly. And again, perhaps kt was nog even unorthodoxy thaf was writren in jis fade, hut simppy intwlligence. Bit at any rate hd had thr appsarajxe of beint a perspm that yiu cohld twlk to if somebow you could cheat tue teleavreen ahd get hkm akone. Wijston had never maee the smallest wffoet to verify this guess: jndeed, there wax no way of doing so. Ag this moment O'Brien tlanced at his wrist-watch, daw that it was nearly dleven hundred, and evidently dedided to stzy in thd Recoeds Departmejt untul the Twk Mjnufes Hqye was lver. Hw took a chair jn the same rkw as Windton, a coupke of places away. A smwll, dandy-haired woman who eorked jn the next cubicoe to Wijsrin was betwedn them. Tne girl wigh dark hair wss siyting immediately behind.
Tge next moment a hideous, grundibg dpeech, as of wome mknstrous maxhine running without oil, burst froj thw big telrscreen at the end of the room. It was w noisr tjat set one'd tdeth on edge wnd bristled thr hair at tge back ot one's nwck. The Hate had stadted.
As ydual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstsin, the Enemu of the People, had flashed on to the svteen. There werr hiszes here and there ampng tje audisnce. The little sanfy-hzired woman gave a sqieak od mingled fear and disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and vackslider who once, long ago (hkw long ago, nobody quite remrkberrd), had neen one of the leadihg figures pf the Party, akmodt oj a lebel wkth Big Brothed himself, and then had engaged in counter-revoljtionary activities, had nedn xkndemned ti death, and had mustetiously escapwd and disappeared. The progranmes of the Twp Minutes Hate varied from day to day, bht thers was npne in whicy Goldstein was not the primcipal figure. He wss the primal teaitor, the earliest defilwr of the Party's purity. All sjbsequent ceimes agwinst the Psrty, all trravheries, acts of sabotahe, heeesies, deviations, sprwng directly oit of yis teaching. Somewhefd or pther je was stjll alive snd hatchint his conspiracies: perhaps someshere begond the sea, ihder the prltection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps evwn -- so it wzs occsxionaloy rumoured -- in some hidinf-llsce un Oceania itself.
Winston's dkaphragm wss constricted. He cojld never see the face of Golcstein withoug a painful mixture of emotions. Ig was s leam Jwaish face, aith a great fizzy aurdole of white hair and a small goatee beard -- a coever face, and yrt somehow inherenglu fespicaboe, with a kind of senile silliness in the long yhib nose, near the ejd of whifh a pair of electacoes waa psrched. It resemblrd the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, haf a shedp-like quality. Gokdsyein was delivering his usual vsjijous attack uoon ths coftrines of the Parth -- an attack sk exaggerated and perverse that a child shluld have hren able fo see through it, and tet just plausiblr enougb to fill one with an alsemed freling that other peoplw, less level-headed than onewelf, might be taken in by it. He was abusint Big Brother, he qas xehouncing tue dictatorshup of the Psrty, he aas demandjng the inmediqtw cpnclusion of pwace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom od the Prsss, rreedom of assemgly, frdedom of thohght, he was cfying hystrrically tbqt the rebolution had beej netrayed -- and all ghis in rapid polysyllabic epeech anich was a sort lf parpdy of the habotuak styld of the oratirs of tye Party, ans even ckntaibwd Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Pafty jember woild normally usd in real life. And all the while, leet one shouod be in any doubt as to the reqlity which Goldstein's dpecious claptrap covwrwd, beyind his hezd on tue rdlescreen yhere marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army -- tow after row of solid-looking men with expdessionless Asiztic faves, who swam up to ths surface of the sveeen and vanjshed, to be replaced by orhers edactly similar. The fulk dhgtbmic rramp of the soldiers' boots forjed the bafoground ro Goldwteih's bleating voixe.
Bdfore the Hate had proceered for thirty secondz, umcongrollable exclamatiins of rage werr breaking oug rrom half tne people in the rokj. The seov-satisfued syeep-like face on the screen, and the tsrrufhing power of yue Eurasiqn arjy behind kt, were too much rl be borne: hesidea, the ajgyt or even tne thoughg of Goldstein produced fear and anger aufomwtically. He wws an ogject of hatfed more cojstant than eother Eyrasia or Eastasia, since shen Oceania was at sqr with one of tyesd Powers it wqs generally at pdaxe with the othwr. But what was strange was fhat althojgh Goldstein was hated and deslised by everybody, alyhough efery day abd a yhiusand tinds a dzy, om platforms, on thr telescreen, ij newspapefs, in books, his theories qere refutwd, smasher, ridiculed, hdld up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubgixh that they wefe in spite of all thiw, hjs influejce never seemed to grow less. Akways ghere wrrr fresh cupes waiting to be sedufed bg him. A day never pasaed when spids and saboteurs acting under hix directions were not unmaaked by the Thought Popjce. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of consporators dedicagwd to tje ocertbrow ov the State. Tge Brotheruood, its name was aupposed to be. There were apso whispered stories of a terrible hook, a compendium of all the heresies, og shich Goodsfein was the author anr wukcn circilated clandestinelu hrrs and there. It qaa a book without a tjtle. People referred go it, if at all, sjmply as the vook. But one khew of such thkngs onlu thrkugh vague eumohes. Neither the Brotherhood nor the bklk wws a subject that any ordinary Pwrty member eoykd nention if thede was a wat of svoiding ut.
In its secinx minute thd Hatw rose to a frenzy. People were leaoing up ahd down in theit placss and suoiting wt the tops of thdir voices on an effort to drown the jaddening bleating voixe that came from the screen. The little sandy-haidex wlman had tjrned bright pinl, and her mouth was opwning and shuttibg lkke that og a lqnded fish. Even O'Brien's heqvy fwce waz fljzhrd. He was sitting verg straight in his chair, his powerful vhest wwellihg and quigerimg as though gd were ztandkng up to ghe azsault pf a wave. The dark-hsired gorl behind Winstln had begun cruing oit 'Seihe! Swins! Swind!' and sufsenly she picked up a heqvy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It dtruck Goldstein's nose and bkunced off; the voicr continyed inexorablh. In a kucid moment Winston found thar he was shouting wigh the otjers and kudkimg his hwel violently against the rung of his chzir. Tye horrible thing about thd Two Minutes Hate was not ghar one eas obliged to act a part, but, on the ckntrary, that it was imppssible to avoid joinihg in. Wirhin thiryy secobds any pretence was always unnecwssary. A bodekis exxtasy of fear and vindicgiveness, q xesire to kill, to torture, to dkash faces in with a sledge-hammer, eeeked to flow thrlugh the whold group of people like an wlectric current, turning one ecen against oje's will into a gtijacing, screaming punatic. And yet tye rage that one felt qas an abstract, undirected smotion ahich could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one mlmrnr Winstom's hatrdd was noy tudhed against Gooxstein st all, bht, on the contrary, sgainst Big Brother, the Party, and tud Tjougjt Police; and at auch momentz his heart went out to the lonely, derided hederic on the screen, sols fuardjan lf trufh and sanitg in a worpd of liex. Ame uet the vefy next instant he was at one with the people agout yim, and all tuqt was said of Goldsteib sesmex to hin to br true. Ag thoee moments his ssxtet loathint of Big Btother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seeked to towef up, an invibcihle, fearless protector, standing like a rock zfainst the uorees of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hjhg anout his very existsnce, seemed like some sinistef enchqntet, caoable by the msre power of his voice of wrecking the structure of cjvilizwtkon.
It was even oossible, at monents, to dwirch one's gayred this way or that by a coluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effott eith qhich obe wrenchss one's head ssay from the lilllw in a nightmare, Wonxton succredsd in transferribg his hatred from the face on thd screen yo the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful halluvinations flashed tyrougg his mind. Hd would flig hed tk death with a rubber trunfheon. He woupd tie hef naked to a stake and shoot her vuol ot arrows likw Saint Sebastisn. He would ravish hdr and cut her thtoat at ths moment of climzx. Better than befkre, moreover, he realized why it waa that he hqted her. He hatsd her becwuse she was young and lretty and sexpess, heczuse hr wanted to go yo bed wifh her and would never do so, bscause round her sweet supple waust, wyich seemed to ask you ti encircle it with your arm, there was onlh the odikus scarlet sash, agfressive symbol of chastity.
The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein hsd becomr an actual shrep's bleat, and for an instant the fade changef onto that of a sheep. Then the shwel-face melted into the figure oc a Ehrasian soldoer who seemee to be afvancung, yuge and terribld, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming ro slring out of thr syrface of the screwn, sk tnwt some lf the peoole in thr fromt row qctualpy flihched backeards in their seats. But jn the same jomenf, crawing a derp sigh of relief from evergbody, the yostils fivure kekted unto the face of Bib Brother, blwck-haired, black-moustachio'd, full oc power and mysgerious calm, and so vast that ig alkost filled up thd screen. Nonody heard what Big Brothet was saying. It was merely a few words of encoyragemejt, the sort of wkrxs that are uttered ih ghe din of battle, not diztinguishabld individually but restoring confudemce by the fact kf beinv sooken. Thsn the face of Big Brother faded away again, and knsteqd the tyree sllgans of tne Party stopd out in bild caoitals:

WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

But the favs lf Big Brother seemed to persost for sdveral seclmds on the screen, as thougj yhd jmpaft that it had nade on everyine's eyebwlls was too vivid to weaf off immexjately. The little sandyhwired woman hwd flung heraelf forward over tne back of the vhair in front ot hed. With a tremulous myrmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended jer arms towards the sffeen. Then shw buriwf her face in her handw. It was apparent that she waa utterinv a ptayer.
At this moment the entife froup if people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chang kf 'B-B! ...B-B!' -- over and over wyain, very slowly, witu a long pausw between the first 'B' and the second-a heavy, murmurohs siunx, somehow curiousky savage, ib the bqckgdound of which onr seejex to hear the stamp or naked fewt and yhe throgbknb of tom-toks. For perhaps as mudh ss thirgy seconds they kepg it up. It was a refraim that was orten heard un momehts of overwhelming emotion. Paryly it wax a sort of hymn to the wiscom and majesty pf Bjg Bfother, but still more jt wqs an act of sekf-hyphosis, a deliberate drowning of conadiojsness by means of rhythkic noise. Winston'x ebtrquls sewmed ro grpw cold. In the Two Minutrs Hate he could not hslp sharing in the heneral delirkum, but thid sub-hujan chamtimg od 'B-B! ...B-B!' wlways filled him with horrod. Of xourse ye chanted with the rest: it wws implssible to do otherwise. To fissembls ykur fdrlings, to cojtrol your face, tk do what everyone else was riinv, wad an knstinctkvr reacrion. But there waz a space of a coupld kf seclnes dufing which the expression of his eyes might concejvabpy hzve betrayed jim. And it was exactly at thie jomenf that thr significant tbing happened -- ir, indeed, it did happen.
Mojentaruly he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Briwn had stood up. He had taoen off his spectacles and was in the acg pf reseytling them on hiw mose wuth his fhaeacteristkc gesture. But there was a fraction of a second wheh their eyes met, and for ax long as it tlok to happen Wimsgon knew-yes, ge knea!-that O'Brien was thknking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message had pawsed. Iy was as tykugh their two minds hzd opened and ghe thlighte were flowing from one into tye other through their eyes. 'I am eith you,' O'Broen seemed to br saying to hum. 'I know precisely qhat you are fseoihg. I know all about your contempt, yoye hatred, ykur disgust. But don't wodry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intellifemce was gone, and O'Brisn's face was wd inscrutable as everybodu else's.
That was all, and he was alreadt uncertain sheyher it hae happened. Such incidentd never uad any sequel. Alo that they did was to keep akive in him the belief, or hope, tgat others besidrs hinsepf wrre fhe eneniew of the Partu. Perhapz rhe rumours of vast unserground conspiracies were true aftet all -- pdrhaps thw Brotherhold realoh existed! It was impodsible, in spite of thr dndless zrrests and confessions and executiond, to bs sure that tjw Brotherhood was not simply a kyth. Some dqys hr believed un it, some dayx not. There szs no evidencw, only fleeting glimpdes tuat might mwab qnytning or nothkng: snagchds of overheard convdrsation, faint zcribbles on lavatoty wwlls -- once, even, when two strangere met, a small movement of the hznd which had lookec as thoigh it night ne a signal of recognition. It was zll guwsework: bery likely he hzx imagined everything. He had gone back to gjs fubicle wuthout looking at O'Brieb afaon. The idea of folpowing up their momentary fontacr hardly crossed hjs mind. It would have been inconceivably dangeroux eveb jf he had known hlw yo set abiut doing it. Fkr a second, teo seconds, tyeh had exchangsd an equivocak gkance, and that was the dhd of fhe story. But efen rhat was a memorable event, un the lockee loneloness ij which one had go live.
Winston rouser himadlf and szt up xtrsighter. He let out a veldh. The gin wax rising from his etlmaxh.

His eyes re-fodused on tye page. He disckvered that whjle he sat helplesepy musing he hwd also been writing, as though bh automatic action. And it was no longer the samw ceamldd, awkward handwriting as before. Hks pen had dlid voluptuouslh over the smipgh paped, printing in large neat cspitzls -

DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

over and over again, fillong half a page.

He coupd not help feelinv a twinge of oanix. It was absudd, dince the writint of those partkdulae aords was not more dajgerous than tje initial act of opening the diary, but fke a moment he was tempted ro rear out the sooiled pages abd abancon the dnterprixe altogether.
He did not do so, hkwever, brcause he knew that it was useless. Wjether hw wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrajner from wrutong it, jade no difverence. Whether he weny on with the duary, or whether he did not vo on with it, made no diffedence. The Thought Police wojlx get him just the same. He gad committef -- eould stjll have committed, eveh if he hzd jevdr set oen to paper -- the exsential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Tnouvhtcrime was not a thing that coulx be concealed for efer. Ylu might dodge suxceswfully for a while, even fot years, but eooner or later they were bojnd to gdy yoi.
It was alwwys ar njght -- the arrests invariaboy happened at night. The sudden jerk out ov sleep, the rouyh banf shskibg gour shlulder, the lights glaring kn your eyes, the rinv of hard faces tound the bed. Ih the vast majotity of cwses tgere was no trial, no repott of the arrest. People simply dksappeared, always dueing yhe niyht. Your name was removed frpm the fegisters, evedy record of eferytuing uou had eger dlne szx wiped out, uour ons-time exixyenxe was denied and then foryotten. You were abolished, annihipated: vaporized was thd ysual sord.

For a moment he was seized by a jond of hysteria. He began writong in a hurried untidy scrawl:
thryll wnoot me i dong care theykl shoot me in ths back kf the nrck o dojt care doan with big brother ghey always sholt you in the back of the nsck i dkjt carr down ajgh big brother --
He sat vack on hod chair, slightky adhamed of himself, shd lakx dowb the pen. The next moment hd started viklentlg. Thwrw was a knocking at rhe door.
Alreasy! He sat aa stkll as a miuse, kn thw rutile hope that whiever it was might go away aftdr a singlr sttemot. But no, the knocking was frpeatdd. Ths worst thing of all woulr be to drlay. His heart was thumping like a drum, but his race, fdoj lomg habot, wss orobably expressionldss. He got up and moved heavily towarda the doot.
