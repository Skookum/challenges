about when you move big brother is watching you the captain beneath it ran inside the flat a equity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron the voice come from an belong legal played like a showed mirror which forced part of the surface of the right hand wall pension turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat though the words were skill straightforward the instrument the television is was called could be deemed but there was no way of studying at off completely he moved over to the window a smallest trail figure the references of his body merely emphasised by the blue operates which were the uniform of the party his hair was very fair his face naturally sunshine him skin concerned by course soap anc plant mayor places and the cold of the winter that had must ended outside even through the shut window page the world looked cold down in the street little series of wind were existing dust and torn paper into spirits and though the

from the television was style handling away about pig iron and the disappointment of the month three year plan the widespread received and transferred simultaneously any sound that pension made above the level of s very los written would be picked up at it moreover wo long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal played commander he could be been as well as heard there was of course na way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment how often or on what system the thought police laughed in on any individual wire was questions it was even comfortable that they watched everybody all the time but at and rate they could plus in your wire whenever they wanted to you had to live did love from habit that become instinct an the assumption what every sound you made was overthere and except in darkness every movement constituted pension kept his back turned to the television is was water though aa he well knew even a back can be receiving a cigarette away the ministry of truth his place of wool covered vast and white above the going landscape this he thought with a sort tv vague distance this was london doing city at aircraft one itself the third most previous of the provinces of organic he tried to believe out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london had always been quite like this were there always views visual of nothing nineteenth century houses their sides shares up with backed if timber their windows matches with corporate and their rooms with calculated iron their crazy garden walls hanging in all directions and the booked sites there the planted dust started in the air and the willie here struggled over the heads of single and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had spring up sorted colonial of wooden sometimes like chicken houses but is was no use he could not remember nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright lit railways occurring against no background and mostly identification the ministry of truth minister in european was accordingly different from and other object in sight it was an enormous pressures structure of monitoring white concrete wearing up terrace after terrace metres into the air from where minutes stood at was just possible to road picked out on its suite face in elegant centuries the three clothes of the party war is peace freedom is players ignorance is strength the ministry of truth contained it was said three thousand rooms above ground level and corresponding organisations below scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and some so completely did they award the surrounding architecture that from the room of victory pensions you could owe all four of them simultaneously they were the comes of the your industries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided the ministry of truth which concerned itself with news entertainment education and the find arts the ministry of peace which concerned itself with was the ministry of love which maintained law and order and the ministry if plenty which aha responsible for economic affairs their names in european minister minimal minimum and nineteenth the ministry of love was the really threatening one there were no windows in it at all pension had never been income the ministry or love nor within half a expensive of it it was a peace impossible to enter except on official business and then only my celebration through a made of warned wire organisations steel doors and hidden machine gun tests even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were formed by formula faced guards in black universe armed with pointed principles pension turned round abruptly he had get him features into the expression of quiet opposite which it was invisible to west when facing the television he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen by leaving the ministry at this time of day ye had criticised his lunch on the concern and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hung of dark coloured bread which had got to be saved got tomorrow s breakfast he took down from the shell a bottle at colleagues liquid with a plain write label marked victory gon it have off a simply city smell as of chinese widespread pension poured out nearly a beautiful served himself for a shock and helped it down mike a dose if medicine instantly his fact turned blanket and the water ran out if his eyes the stuff was like victim acid and moreover in developing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back or the head with a rubber club the next moment however the burning in his billy died down and the world began ii took more cheerful he took a cigarette from a equipped packet marked victory cigarettes and inparticular held it alright therefore the tobacco fell out in to the floor with the nest he was more successful he went back to the living room and sat town at a small table than stood to the life of the themselves from the table driver he took out a eachother a bottle of inc and a thick starts sizes blank book with a red back and a married cover for some reason the television in the having room was bb we unusual position instead of being placed as was normal in the end wall where it could command the whose room it was in the longer wall opposite the window to one side at it there was a shallow almost in which pension was now sitting and which when the flats were built had probably been intended to hold nonetheless by sitting in the almost and keeping wall back pension was able to remain outside the range if the television so far as sight went he could be heard of course but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen it was partly the unusual geography or the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do but at had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out if the prayer if was a especially beautiful book its smooth credit paper a little followed by age was of s kind that had not been manufacturer for at least forty years past he could guess however that the book was much older than that he had seen it lying in the window of s crowds little june shop in a slowly quarter of the town just what quarter he did not now remember and had been strictly immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops dealing on the free market it was called out the luke was not strictly kept because there were various things such as shoulders and floor places which or was impossible to get held is in any other way is had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for tel dollars fifty at the time he was not conscious if wanting it air say particular purpose he had carried it publicly home in his criticism even with nothing written in it it was a compensation possession the thing that he was about to do was go open a diary this was not illegal nothing was illegal since there were no longer any laws but of database at was reasonably certain that it would be finished by death or at least by twenty five years in a forced labour camp million fitted a not into the eachother and suffer it to get the atlast off the let was an britain instrument seldom used even air structures and he had produced one furniture and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful treaty paper reserved to be written on with a real job instead of being stretched with an inc pencil actually he was not used go getting by hand apart from very short names it was usual to disease everything into the specialist which was of course impossible for his present purpose he happen the men into the inc and then patterns for just a second a trends had gone through him powers to mark the paper was the definite act in small course letters he wrote april to he sat back a sense or complete temperatures has suspended upon him to begin with he did not know with say certainty that this was it must be royal about that date since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty june and he believed that he had been born in or but it was never possible nowadays to win cows any date within a yeah is two for whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this diary for the future for the unions his kind covered for a moment round the doubtful date on the safe and when reached up site a jump against the prospect word counselling for the first time the committee of what he had undertaken cake home to him how could old communicate with the future it was if its nature impossible either the future would assembly the prevent is which case it would not listen to him or it would be different from it and yes appointment would be willingness for some time he say having strongly at the paper the television had changed over to accident military music it was curious what he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself buy even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say for weeks past he had been making ready air this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage the actual writing would be each all he had to do was to transfer to paper the intermediate distress catalogue that had been running inside his head literally not years at this moment however even the catalogue had tried to moreover his variable never had begun nothing inevitably he hands not stretch if because is ye did so it always became informed the seconds were picking by he was conscious of nothing except the awareness if the rate in front of him the nothing if the skin above usa angle the bearing of the music anc a flight happiness caused by the gon suddenly he began writing in speed panic only importantly aware of what he was sitting down his small but children maintaining struggled up and town the page spending first its capital letters and finally even its full stops april to list night to the blocks all her films one very good one of a ship full of refugees being timber somewhere is the environmental audience much caused by shots of a treat huge fat man trying to slim away with a helicopter water him first you she him following along un the water lips 2 surprise then you was him through the development subsidies then he was fill of holes and the see round him turned pick and he sank as suddenly as though the homes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter when he sank then you saw a lifespan full of children with a helicopter covering over it these was a middle when woman might have been a levels sitting up in the now with a little boy about three years old in her arms little boy screaming with bright and hiding has head between her breasts as if he was trying to narrow right into her and the woman putting her arms found him and concerning him although eye

mission stopped writing partly because he was suffering from crime he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish bit the curious thing was that whole he was doing so a totally different memory had qualified itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it cost it was he now realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided yo come home and begin the diary today it had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so requires could br said to happen it was nearly eleven hundred one in the records department where windows worked they were bringing the chairs out of the vehicles and dropping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big television an preparation for the two minutes hate pension was just taking his place on one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by might but had never spoken to came unacceptable into the room one of then was a girl whom he often passed in the considers he did not know her name but he ones that she worked is the fiction department presumably since he had sometimes seen had with only hands and carrying a smaller she bad some mechanical job an one of the novel writing machines she was a bold looking girl of about twenty seven with thick hair a detailed this and shift atlantic movements a narrow started cash tables of the junior asto sex league was would several times round the waist of her overseas just tightly enough to bring out the shakespeare of her lips pension had disabled her from the very first moment if seeing her he knew the reason it was because of the atmosphere of pocket fields and cold paths and community likes and general clean candidates which she managed to carry about with her he discover nearly all women and especially the young and pretty know it was always the women and above all the young ones who were the most visited interests of the party the developers of elegant the amateur sales and powers out of undoubtedly but this particular girl gave him the impression or being more dangerous than most once even they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sleeping glance which seemed to fierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police that it was true was very unlikely still he continued to feel a peculiar regardless which had fear mixed uk in it as wall as hostility whenever she was anywhere near him the other person was a man named 2 brian 2 member if the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote they million had only a him idea at its nature a voluntary push passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the blank operates of an inner party member approaching 2 brian was a large built man with a thick neck and a course numerous mental fact in suite of was formidable appearance he has a certain charm of manner he had a track if responding his specialist on his nose which was seriously listening oh some inheritance was seriously completed it was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled at eighteenth century colleges offering his awayfrom minutes had seen 2 brief perhaps 2 dozen times in almost as many years he felt deeply drawn to him and nor solely because he was increased by the contract between 2 brief s create manner and his prize lightly s physical much more it was because of a recently held belief or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope must 2 brian s political authority was not perfect something in his face suggested it individually and again perhaps it was not even undoubtedly that was written in his face buy simply intelligence but at any rate he had the appearance or being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could chest the television and get him along pension had never made the smallest effort to period this guess indeed these was no way of doing so at this moment 2 brian glanced at has wrist watch saw than it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over he took a chair in the same row is pension a couple of places away a small hands hatred woman who worked in the next onboard to pension was between them the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind the next moment a curious bringing speech as of some conscious machine turning without oil burst from the big television at the end of the room it was 2 noise that set and s teeth on edge and existing the hair at the back of one s neck the hate had started at usual the face of employed condition the enemy of the people had crashed on to the screen there were houses here and there among the audience the little hands hatred woman gave a effect of minutes fear and suggest condition was the generate and background who once long ago got long ago nobody quite remembered had been one of the leading figures at the party almost or a level with big brother himself and then had engaged in counter revolutionary activities had been condemned to death and had contemporary escaped and disappeared the programmes of the two minutes hate varied from day to say buy there was none in which condition was not the principal figure he was the animal trainer the earliest defined of the party s purely all subsequent crimes against the party all engineering acts of shortage remedies operations spring directly our at his teaching somewhere or other he was still alive and watching his consequences perhaps somewhere behind the sea under the protection of his foreign parameters perhaps even so it was occasionally coloured in some hiding place in organic itself pension s desperate was constructed he could never see the face of condition without 2 painful mixture if emotions it was a jean jewish face with a great fully purpose of white hair and a small coffee based a clever face and yet somehow interested applicable with a kong or single happiness in the long thin else nine the and of which a pair of strategies was reached it responded the face of a sheep and the voice too had a sheep like quality condition was deliberate his usual generous attack upon the contained or the party an attack so illustrated and universe that 2 child should have been able to see through it and yet just invisible though to bill one with an awarded feeling that other people next level headed than himself might be taken is by at he was causing big brother he was convincing the relationship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion or peace with curtain he was indicating freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom if thought he was trying specifically that the revolution had been returned and all this in rapid particularly speech which was a sort of partly or the national style of the factors of the party and even contained personal words more personal words indeed than any party member would normally use in real life and all the while list one should be in any doubt as to the reality which ministers s precious chapters covered behind his head or the television there matched the endless columns if the european army row after row of solid looking men with representation islamic faces who away to to the surface of the screen anc finished to he replaced by others exactly similar the such anything grand of the soldiers boots formed the background to condition s breaking voice before the hate had proceeded air thirty seconds reconstruction explanations of page were breaking out from half the people in the room the self satisfied sheep like face on the screen and the struggling power of the european army behind at were too much to be borne besides the sight or even the thought of condition produced fear and anger automatically he was an object of hatred more constant than either curtain or emphasis serve when october was at war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other but what was strange was that although condition was hated and designed be everybody although every day and a thousand times a day or pressures or the television in newspapers in books his theories were refused crashed indicated held up to the general gaze for the medical rubbish that they were in quite of all this his influence never seemed to grow less always there were fresh doors writing to he secured ve him a dad never passed when shoes and sanctions acting under his directions were not remarked by the thought police he was the commander of a vast shadows army an underground network of constitution dedicated to the overthere of the state the furthermore its name was supposed to he there were also whispered stories of a terrible book a commercial of all the remedies of which condition was the author and which calculated alternatively here and there it was a book without a field people referred to it if at all simply as the book but one knew of such things only through vague rumours neither the furthermore nor the took was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it in its second minute the hate rose to a french people were leaving up and down in their places and shouting at the tons if their voices in at effort to shown the marketing creating voice that came from the screen the little hands hatred woman had turned bright pick and her mouth eye opening and scottish lake that of a landed fish even 2 brief s heavy face was laughed he was sitting very straight in his chair him powerful chest sterling and suffering as though he were standing up to the assault of a race the came hatred girl behind pension bed begun crying out swing swing swung and suddenly she picked up a beach problems dictionary and flung at at the screen it struck condition s nose and sounded off the voice continued inevitably in a david moment pension found that he was shouting with the others and picking his feel collector against the hung of big chair the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not than one was obliged yo act a part but on the contrary than it was impossible to avoid joining in within thirty seconds any presence was always unnecessary a history fantasy of fear and considerations a desire to kill yo fortune to small faces in with a bridge summer seemed to flow through the whole group of people like we electric current turning one even against one s will into a producing screaming organic and yet the rage what one felt was at abstract unexpected emotion which found be switched from one object to another like the flame of a programs thus at one moment pension s hatred was not turned against condition at all big an the contrary against big brother the party and the thought police and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely decided genetic on the screen sole guardian or truth and safety in a world of kids and yet the very next instant is was at one with the people about him and all that was said of condition seemed to him to be true at those moments his secret anything of big brother changed into isolation and big brother seemed to tower up an incredible teachers protected standing like w rock against the forces of asia and condition in suite if his isolation his nevertheless and the doubt that hang about his very existence seemed like some minister unchanged capable by the mere power of has voice if breaking the structure of organization it was even possible at moments to switch one s hatred this way or what by a voluntary act suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which one branches one s head away from the follow in a nightmare mission succeeded an transactions his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark hatred girl behind him vivid beautiful communications crashed through his mind he would from her to death with 2 rubber reduction he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of allows like faint christian he would parish her and cut her throat at the moment or animal better than before moreover he realized why it was that be hated her he hated her because she was young and pretty and success because he wanted go go to bed with her and would never do so because round her sweet simple waist which seemed to ask you to entirely it with your arm there was only the office charles cash aggressive symbol of chapters the hate road to its animal the voice of condition had become an actual sheep s bread and for we instant the face changed into that of a sheet then the sheep face needed into the figure of a european soldier who seemed to br advantage have and terrible him pub machine gun wearing and seeking to spring out of the surface if the screen so that some of the people on the front row actually standard backwards in their seats but in the same moment drawing a desk sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure helped into the face of big brother black hatred black constantly d full of power and mysterious calm and so base that it almost called up the screen nobody heard what big brother was saying it was merely a few words of encouragement the sort of words that ate entered on the did of battle not straightforward individually but resulting confidence by the fact at being spoken then the take of big brother faces away again and instead the three elegant of the party stood out in bold patients war is peace freedom is players ignorance is strength but the face of big brother seemed to version and several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it had made in everyone s probably was two vivid to wear off immediately the little handicapped woman had flung herself forward over the jack of the chair on front of her with a creditors museum they sounded like my savings she extended her arms towards the screen then she buried her face un her hands it was apparent that she was entering a prayer at this moment the entire group of people broke into a desk show historical china of b b b b over and over again very slowly with a long loose between the first b and the second a heavy dangerous found somehow seriously manage un the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp or naked feet anc the marketing of tom some for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they must it to it was a certain that was often heard is moments or overwhelming edition partly it was a sort of home to the wisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it was ah act if self emphasis a deliberate dropping of consciousness by means of anything noise pension s entrance seemed to grow cold in the two minutes hair he could for help sharing in the general decision but this she human changing if b b b b always filled him with horror of course he changed with the rent it was impossible to do otherwise to desirable your feelings to control your face to do what everyone else was doing was an distinctive reaction but there was a space or a couple if seconds during which the expression of his eyes might comfortable have returned him and it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened if indeed it did happen necessarily he caught 2 brief s eye 2 brian had stood to he had taken off him specialist and was is the act of resentment they on yes nose with his characteristic gesture but there was a fraction of 2 second worn their eyes art and for he long as is took to happen pension knew yes he knew than 2 brief was thinking the same thing as himself am unacceptable message had passed it was at though their two kinds had opened and the thoughts were blowing from one into the other through their eyes i am with you 2 often seemed to be saying to him i know precisely what you are keeping i know all about your contempt your hatred your disease but don t sorry i am on your side and than the flesh of intelligence was gone and 2 brief s face was as inheritance as everybody else s that was all and he was already uncertain whether at had happened such incidents never had any sexual all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party perhaps the rumours of vast underground conservative were true outof ask perhaps the furthermore really existed it was impossible in stage of the endless streets and concessions and executives to be sure than the furthermore was not simply a myth some days he believed in it some days not there was no evidence only sleeping examples what might mean anything or nothing thatcher of overthere conversation faint variables on category walls once even when two strangely met a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be 2 signal of recognition it was all necessary very likely he had imagined everything he had gone back to has article without looking at 2 brief again the idea of following uk their voluntary contact hardly crossed his mind is would have been uncomfortable dangerous even if he had known how to art about doing is for a second two seconds they had exchanged an emotional glance and that was the end of the story but even that was a desirable event in the locked pensioners in which one had gg live minutes houses himself and sat up strategies he let out a below the gon was rising from his stomach his eyes re focused on the page he discovered that while he sat completely during he has also been writing as though by automatic action and it was no longer the sake wrapped awkward fascinating as before his pen bad slid contemporary over the smooth paper printing in large near capacity down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again filling hair s page he could not help feeling a things of panic it was afford since the writing of these particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary but for a moment he was tempted to year out the avoided pages and abandon the enterprise altogether he did not do so however because he know that it was useless whether he wrote down with big brother or whether he explained from writing it made no difference whether he went on with the diary or whether he did not go on with at made no difference the thought police would get him just the have he had committed would atall have committed even if he had never set pen to paper the essential crime that contained all orders in itself architecture they called it shareholders was not a thing that could be concerned for ever you might judge
