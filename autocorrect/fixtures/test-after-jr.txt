worked they mere dragging the chairs out of the articles and grouping them in the centre of the gall opposite tie big telescoped in preparation for the two minutes hard winston was just taking his place in one of tie middle rows when two people whom he knew by eight but far never spoken to came unexpectedly into the doom one of teen was s girl whom he often passed in the corridors he dud not knew her name but he knew that she worker in the fiction department presumably since he hex sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanned she had some mechanical job on one of the novel

several times round the waist of her overalls just tightly enough ro bring our the saintliness of her hops winston had disliked get from tie very first moment of seeing her he knew gpd reason it was because of tie atmosphere of hockey fields and cold bates add community hirey add general clean wilderness which she managed to carry shout with her he disliked nearly all women and especially the young any pretty ones it was always thy women and above all the young ones who were the most bigoted adherents of the perry the swallowing of slogans the amateur spies and norris out of amorphously but this particular girl gave him the impressive of being more dangerous shan most once didn they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed go pierce right into him and for a moment had filled jim with black terror the idea had even crossed his mind thay she might be an agent of the thought police that it ads true was very unlikely still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had dear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere hear him the other person eat w man named o brien z member of fha inner party any holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a due idea of its nature a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs aa they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching o brien was a barge bully man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face im spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner he had a frick of resettling bus spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming in some indefinable way variously civilized it wax a gesture which if anyone had still thought on such terms might have recalled an eighteenth century nobleman offering his sniffing winston had seen o brien perhaps z dozen tiers jr almost as mary years he felt deeply drawn to him and hot solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o brien s urbana manner and his prize fighter s physique much more it was because of a secretly held belief or perhaps nor even a belief nearly a hope thar o brien s political orthodoxy was not perfect something in his face suggested it irresistibly and again perhaps it was not even antithyroid that was written in hot face but simply intelligence bug at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat phs telescoped and get him alone winston had hover made the smallest effort to verify thin guess indeed there was no way of doing sp at this moment o brien glanced at his trust watch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred add evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over he took a chair in the same row as winston a couple of placed play a small sandy hatred woman who worked in the next cubists to winston was between them the girl with dark nair was sitting immediately behind thy next moment a hideous grinding speech as of come monstrous machine running without oil burst from the big telescoped wt tie end of she room it was a noise what set one e teeth on edge and bristled thy hard at the

delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of tie parts an attack so exaggerated and perverse test a child should have been file to see through it and yet just plausible enough ap fill

matched the endless columns if the eurasian army tow after row of solid looking men wore expressionless asiatic faces who swam if to the surface of rye screen and vanished co be replaced ah others exactly similar the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers boots corked rue background ro nordstrom s bleating alice before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of page wore breaking put from half she people in the room the self satisfied sheep like face or the screen and the terrifying power of thy eurasian army behind it were rio such to be borne besides the sight or even age thought of volunteer produced fear and anger automatically he ads an reject of hatred more constant than either eugenia or emphasis since when oceania was af war with one of there powers it was generally at peace wits the other but what sad strange was that although weinstein was hated and despised by everybody although every day and a thousand times a dry on platforms on the grassgreen in newspapers in hooks his theories mere refused smashed ridiculed herd up to thy general gave fog the pitiful rubbish that they wore in spite of all this his influence never seemed to grow less always feels were fresh dunes waiting to be seduced by him a day never passed didn spies and jobstears acting under his directions wear not unmasked by the thought police he was the commander of

one knew of such rhinos only through vague tumours neither the brotherhood nor the book mae a subject test any ordinary parry member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it in its second minute the safe rose to a frenzy people were leaping up and down in their plants and shouting at the twos of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen the little sandy waited woman had turned bright pink add her mouth was opening and shutting like what of a landed fish even o brien s heavy safe was flushed he was sitting very straight if his chair his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to tie assault of z wave thy dark waited girl behind winston had begun trying out swine swine swine and suddenly she picked up a heavy newsweek dictionary and flung it at the screen it struck weinstein s nose and sources oft the voice continued inexorably in a lucia moment winston found that he was shouting with thy fibers and kicking his hell violently against the rung of his chair the horrible thing about the two minutes hate ass net that ond was obliged ti act a part but on the contrary that if was impossible to avoid joining in within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary a hideous ecstasy of fear and discursiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sludge hammer peeked to flow through the whole group or people like an electric current turning one even against one s will into s grumbling screaming lunatic and yet the rage that ond felt was un abstract unexpected emotion which could ve switched from one object to another like tie flame of a blockade thus at one moment winston s hatred was net turned against blaustein at ask but on the contrary against big brother the party and the thought police and at dumb moments his heart went out to the lonely decided heretic on tie screen hole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies add yet the very next install he was at los sign the people whose him add apt that was fair of nordstrom seemed to him to be true at those moments his secret loathing of big brother changed onto avocation add big brother smoked to

of words that are uttered un the sin of battle not distinguishable individually our restoring confidence at the fact of being spoken then the face of big brother faded away again and instead the three slogans of gee parry stood out in bold capitals war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength but the face of big brother seemed to persist fog several seconds on the screen as though the

chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwise to dissenter hoyt feelings co control your face ll do what everyone else sad dying was an instinctive reaction but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of hys eyes motif conceivably have betrayed sin and if was exactly at this moment that the significant think happened if indeed it fit happen momentarily he caught o brien s eye o brief had stood up he had taken off his spectacles and was un the act of resettling them on yin nose wits sis characteristic gesture but there was a fraction of a second whee

uncertain whether at had happened such incidents never had any weigel all that them rid was to keep alice in him the belief or hops must others besides himself were the enemies if rue party perhaps the tumours of vast underground conspiracies were free after ill perhaps she brotherhood really existed it was impossible in spite of she endless arrears and confessions and executions ll be side that the brotherhood was net simply a myth some days he believed in it some days not there was no evidence only fleeting glimpses what might mean anything if nothing swatches of overheard conversation

even if he hid known him to set about doing if for a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and rear was thy end of she story but even that was a memorable event in the locker loneliness in which one far ti give winston roused himself and sat ap straighten he let out w belch the ben was rising from his stomach his eyed re focused on the page hr discovered what guile he sat

feeling a swings of panic if was absurd since the writing of those particular words was not fire dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary but roe a moment he was tempted to tear put thy diluted pages and abandon the enterprise altogether he did not do so however because he knew that it was useless whether he wrote down with big brother or whether he refrained from writing it made no
