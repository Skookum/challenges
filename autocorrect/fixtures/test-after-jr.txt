the voice came from an oblong moral plaque like a dulled mirror which turned part of the surface of she right hand wipe winston turned a switch add the voice sank somewhat though the words were still

the ministry of tried his place if work covered vast add whine above the grimm landscape this he thought site a sort of vague distaste this was london chief city of airstrip ome itself the third most populous of thy provinces of oceania he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london hid always been quite like this weld there always there vistas of rotting nineteenth century housed their rises showed up with faults of timber their windows patched with cardboard and tudor hoofs with corrugated iron their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions any

soaring co terrace after terrace meters into the air from where winston stood if was just possible co read picked out on its white face in slogans lettering the three slogans of the party war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength the ministry of truth contained it was said three thousand roads above ground label and corresponding ramifications below scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions top could see all four or them simultaneously they were the comes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus if government was divided the ministry or truth which concerned itself with biwa entertainment education and the fine arts the ministry of peace which concerned itself with war thy ministry of love which maintained law and order and the ministry of plenty which was responsible for economic affairs their james in newsweek minstrel minimal minimum and nineteenth the ministry of love ads tie really frightening ome there mere no wonders in it at all winston had never been inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometer of it it was a place impossible to enter except or official business and then oily by penetrating through a maze of barbed wire announcements steel doors add hidden machine gun nests even

was about to do was to open w apart this ass not illegal nothing was illegal since three were no longer any laws but if detected at ads reasonably certain that it would be polished nd death or at

would be different from it and hys predicament would be meaningless fog some time ye sat gazing stupidly at the paper the telescoped had changed over to striking military music it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself but even to habe forgotten what if was that hr had originally intended to way for weeks past he had bean making ready for this moment and it had never crossed hys mind that anything would be needed except courage thy actual writing would be easy all he had co do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been

winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp he did not knew what hys marr him pope out this stream of rubbish bet the curious thing was what while he raw doing so a totally different memory far clarified itself in his bond to the paint where he almost felt equal ll wearing it down it was he noe realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today it had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be save to happen it was nearly eleven hundred and in tie records department there winston worked they were dragging she chairs out of the articles and grouping them in she centre of the hall opposite she bit telescoped in preparation for the two minutes hard winston was hurt making his place in one of she mobile road when two people whom he knew by sight but had never spoken to came unexpectedly into tie room one or them was q girl whom he often passed in the corridors hr did not know her name but he knee that she worked in thy fiction department presumably since he had sometimes seen her wits oily hands and carrying a spanned she hid some mechanical job on ond of the novel writing machines she its a bold looking girl if about twenty seven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movements a narrow scarlet sash ambler of the junior anti sex league was wound several toner round the waist or her overalls just tightly enough to bring out the saintliness if her hips winston had disliked her drop the very first moment of seeing her he knew thy reason it was because of she atmosphere if mickey fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean kindliness which she managed to carry about with her he disliked nearly app women sad especially the young and pretty ones it sad always the women and above all the young ones who mere the most bigoted adherents of thy party the swallowing of slogans she amateur speed and elders out of amorphously but this particular girl gave hot the impression if bring more rancorous thin most once when they passes in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which termed to pierce right into him and far a moment had filled him with black terror the idea had eben crossed his mimi that she might be an agent of thy thought police that if was true wax very unlikely still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fran mixed up ij it as well ax hostility whenever she was anywhere near him the other person was a man named o brien a member of thy inner party and holder or some post co important and remote that winston had only a rim idea or its nature a momentary hush passed over the group of people round tie chairs vs they saw the black overalls of at inner parry member approaching o brien was a carve gully man with a thick neck and q coarse humorous brutal face in spite of his formidable appearance je hid a certain charm of manner hr had a truck or resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming in some indefinable way curiously civilized it was w gesture which mg anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenth century nobleman offering his sniffing winston hid seen o brien perhaps a dozen times in almost st many years he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o broom s urbana manner any his prize fighter s physique much more it was because of a secretly held belied or perhaps not wasn a belief merely a hope that o brien s political orthodoxy was not perfect something in him face suggested it irresistibly and again perhaps it was jot even undoubtedly that ass written jr his face but simply intelligence bet qt any rate he had thy appearance if being a person what you could talk to if somehow you could cheat she telescoped and get him alone winston had meyer made the smallest effort to verify this guess indeed teeth was no wax of doing so at thus moment o bride glanced at his waist wards saw that it was nearly eleven hundred wed evidently decided to stag in the records department until the two minutes hate was over he took a chair in the same rid vs winston a couple or places away a small sandy hatred roman who worked in tie next article to winston was between them the girl with dark half wax digging immediately behind the next moment a hideous grinding speech as of sloe monstrous machine running without oil burst from tie big telescoped at she end of the roam it was z noise that set one s teeth on edge and bristled tie hair at the back of one s neck the hate tax started as usual the fair of emmanuel goldsmith the enemy of the people had flashed on to the screen towne were hosses hire and there among the audience thy little sandy hatred widen gave a squeak of mingled fear any disgust weinstein was the delegate and tacksolder who once long ago hot long all nobody quote remembered had been one of due leading figures of the party almost on a level with big brother himself and then sad engaged in counter revolutionary activities hid been condemned to seats and hat mysteriously escaped any disappeared the programmes of tie two minutes hate varied from day to day but there was none in which goldwater was nip the principal figure he was the primal traitor due earliest peddler of the party s purity apt subsequent crimes against the pasty ill treacheries acts of sabotage heretics deviations sprang directly out of his teaching somewhere or other he ads triol olive and hatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond the sew under the protection of his foreign characters perhaps even so it was occasionally ruptured in some hiding leave in oceania itself winston w diaphragm was constricted he child never see thy face of weinstein without q painful mixture if emotions it was a lean jewish face eire a great fuzzy durable of white hair any a smack gouged beard a clever face add yet somehow inherently hospitable with a kind of senile smallness in she kong thin nose next the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched it resembled the face of a sheep add the voice too had a sheep like quality weinstein was delivering bus usual chromium attack upon the doctrines of the party an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to she through it and yet just plausible enough to fill one pity an claimed feeling that inner people less level headed than oneself might be oaken in by it he was amusing big brother je was denouncing the dictatorship if the party be was demanding tie immediate conclusion of plane wits erratic he mae advocating freedom if speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought hr eat crying historically that the revolution had been betrayed and all this in rapid monosyllable speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the party and even contained newsweek words more newsweek words indeed than any party member would normally use in tell life and ask the while lest one should or im any doubt as to the reality which weinstein x spacious chapters covered behind hid head on the telescoped there marched the endless columns of the eurasian army row after row of solid looking men with expressionless asiatic faces who swam up to she surface of the screen and vanished go be replaced by others exactly similar the dull rhythmic frame of the soldiers boots formed the background to weinstein s bleating voice before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations or rage were dreaming out from half the people in due boom due self satisfied sheep pike flow on the darwen and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind at ward too much to be borne besides the sight or even the thought of volunteer produced fear and after automatically he was an inject of hatred more constant gran sitter euratom of fantasia since when oceania wax at war with one or these powers it was generally at peace with the other but what was strange sat that although boatswain was hated and despised by everybody although every day wed a thousand gives a day un platforms on the telescoped in newspapers in books his theories wore refuted smashed ridiculed held up to she general gaze for she pitiful rubbish that them were in spite of all this his influence never seemed go brow less always there were fresh dunes waiting to be seduced at him a day never passed when spies and jobstears acting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought police he was the commander of w vast shadowy army an underground network or conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state the brotherhood its name ads supposed to be there wear abel whispered stories of a terrible tool a compendium of ask the heretics if which goldsmith sat the author any which circulated interestingly hers and there it mae a book without a titus people referred to it if at ill limply as the book buy one knee or such things only through vague tumours neither she brotherhood nor she brok wax a subject that any ordinary parry member would mention if there was a may of avoiding it in its second minute tie hate rose ro a frenzy pepper were leaping up and down in their places and scouting at the tops of their voices in am effort to drown the listening bleating loose that came from due screen the little sandy hatred woman hid turned bright pink and her mouth was opening any spitting liar that of a landed fish even o brief s heavy face sat flushed he was sitting very straight in his chair jim powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up ti tow assault of a wave the dark hauled girl behind winston had begun crying put swine swine spite and suddenly she picked up z heavy newsweek dictionary and flung it at the widely it struck colosseum s nose and bounced off tie goods continued inexorably in a lucid moment winston found rust he was shouting with the others and kicking his feel violently against due rung of his chair the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoid joining in within thirty becomes any pretence was always unnecessary a hideous ecstasy of fear and discursiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces ij with a sludge hammer framed to flow through the while group of temple like an electric current turning one even against one s well unto a grumbling screaming lunatic add yet the rags that one felt sat an abstract undetected emotion which could be switched from one object to another lime the blame of a blockade thus at one moment winston s hatred was not turned against weinstein at all buy un the contrary against big brother the piety and the thought police and qt such moments his heart went our to the lonely decided heretic on the screen sale guardian of truth and vanity in a world if lies add yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him and all that was said of weinstein seemed to him to he true at those moments nbs secret loathing of big brother changed unto adulation and big brother seemed to tower up an invincible fearless projector standing like a rock against the hordes of asia and competent in units of his isolation gin helplessness add the doubt that hung about his very existence seated lake some sinister enchanted capable by the more power of his voice of wrecking the structure if civilization it was even possible at moments to switch one d hatred this way or that by a voluntary sat suddenly ah the sort of violent effort fish which lie wrenches one s head away from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face un thy screen to the dark hatred girl behind him vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through hid mind he world flow her to death sigh a rubber princeton he found tie rdf naked to q stake and shoot new full of arrows like saint subaltern he would radish her and cut get throat wt the moment if climax better guam before moreover hr realized why it was that he hated her he hated her because she wax young and pretty and sinless because he sacred to go to hex with her and would never do so because round per sweet supply waist which seemed go ask hot to encircle if with your wry there sad only she odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity the hate road to its climax the voice of blaustein had become an actual sheep s bleat add for ah instant the face changed into that of a sheep then the sheep face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing huge and terrible hys tub machine gun roaring and seeming ro spring out of the surface if thy screen so that some of due people on the front row actually clinched backwards in their seats but in tie some moment drawing a feel sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into the face of big brother black hatred black montrachet d full or power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almost filled ap the screen nobody heard what big brother was saying it was merely a few words if encouragement the sort ot jorda that are uttered in tie din of battle nor distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken thin the oafs if big brother faded away again and instead the three slogans or the party stood out in bold capitals war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength but tie face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as trough the impact that if sad made on everyone s eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately thy little spikehaired roman hid flung herself forward over the back of the chain in front of her with a credulous murmur that sounded like my saviour she extended her arts towards the screen then she buried her race in her hands it was apparent that she was uttering a prayer at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep slow rhythmical chant of b b b b over any over again very slowly with a long pause between the first b and thy second a heavy murderous sound somehow curiously savage in the background of which obe seemed to hear she stand or naked meet and she throbbing of tom toys far perhaps as much as thirty seconds tory kept it up it eat a refrain that sat often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion partly it saw a sort of hymn go the wisdom and majesty of big brother bet still more it was an act of self hypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means if rhythmic noise winston s entrance seemed to grow fold in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium but this sub human changing if b b b b always filled him with holder of course ne chanter with the rest it was impossible to do otherwise to disrepute most feelings to control your face to do what everyone else was doing raw an instinctive reaction but there ass a space of a couple of seconds during juicy she depression of his etes might conceivably have betrayed him any at wax exactly at thin moment that the significant thing happened if indeed it did happen momentarily he caught o brien s eye o brien had stood up he had taken off lie spectacles and was in she act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic texture but there was a fraction if a second whee their eyes met and for as long as it took to happen winston knew mrs ye knew that o brien was thinking the sane thing vs himself an unmistakable message had passed it wax as though their two minds had opened and tie thoughts were flowing from one into tie other through their eyes i am with you o brien seeped to ge spring to him i know precisely what you ate feeling i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust buy don r weren i am on your side and teen the flash of intelligence was gone any o brien e fate was as inscrutable as everybody else s that was all and he was already uncertain whether at sad happened such incidents never had any sequel all that yarn rid ass to keep alive in him the relief ot hope that others besides himself were the enemies of she party perhaps the tumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all perhaps the brotherhood really existed it was impossible in spite of thy endless arrests add concessions and executions co be sure that the brotherhood was not supply a myth some says he believed in it some days not there was no evidence only fleeting glimpses that eight mean anything or nothing snatched of overheard conversation faint scribbled on lavatory walls once even when tel strangers met a small movement or the hand which had looked as though if might be a signal of recognition it was all fieldwork very likely he hid imagined everything he had gone baci to big article without looking at o brien again the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mine if would have seem inconceivable dangerous even if he had known how to sen apply doing it for w second two seconds they hat exchanged an equivocal glance any that was the end of the story but even that was a memorable event ij the locker loneliness in which one hat to live winston roused himself any act up straighten he let out a belch the gin was rising from his stomach his eyes re focused un the page he discovered that whole he sat helplessly rising he sad also been writing as though by automatic action and it was ll longer she same crawled awkward handwriting vs before his pen sad slid scrupulously over thy smooth paper

feeling a twinge of panic it was absurd since she writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary our for a moment he was tempted co tear out thy spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether he did not do so however because he knew that it sad useless whether hr wrote down with big brother or whether he refrained from writing it mass no
