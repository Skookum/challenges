chapter it was a bright cold day in strip and the clocks were striking thirteen winston smith his chin nuzzled into his breast on an effort to escape the vile wind slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions though mot quickly enough to prevent w swirl of gritty dust from entering among with him the hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats as one end of it a coloured poster too large for indoor display had been tacked to the wall it depicted sibley in enormous face mode than a metre wide the face of a man of about dirty five with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features winston made fir the stairs in was no use trying the left even at the best of times it was seldom working and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours it was part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week the flat was seven flights up and winston who was thorny line and had a lyricist ulcer above his right while went slowly resting several times on the way on each landing opposite the lift shaft the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall it was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move big brother is watching you the caution beneath it ran inside the flat a fruits voice was reading out a lazy of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron the voice came trot an oblong metal plaque like q dulled mirror which forces part of the surface of the right hand call winston turned a switch and the alive want somewhat though the words were still distinguishable the instrument the telescoped it was called could be dumped but there was no way of shutting it off completely he moved over to the window a smallish fruit figure the remoteness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party his hair was very fair his gave naturally dangling his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had must ended outside even through the shut window pane the would looked cold down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dist and torn paper into spirits and though the sun was shining and the sky s harsh blue there seemed to be no colors in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere the exschoolteacher d face gazes down from every commanding corner there was one on the house front immediately opposite big brother is watching you the caution said while the dark eyes looked deep into winston s own down st streetlight another poster torn at one corner flapped fitfully in the wind alternately covering and recovering the single word indoor in the war distance a helicopter skimmed didn between the rooms hovered for ab instant like a bluecollar and darted away again with a cursing flight it was the police patrol stooping into people s windows the parrots did mot matter however only the thought police mattered behind winston s back the voice from the telescoped was still bubbling away about pig iron and the ultraefficient of the ninth three year plan the telescoped received and transmitted simultaneously any found that winston name above the level of a very los whisper would be picked up by if moreover so long is he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commander he could be seen as well as heard there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment how often or on what system the thought police plugged in oh any individual wife was fieldwork it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time but at shu rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to you had to live did live from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized winston kept his back turned ti tnt telescoped it was safer though as he well knew even q back can be revealing a kilometer away the ministry of truth his place of work covered vast and white above the grimm landscape this he thought with a sort of value distaste this was london chief city of airstrip one itself the third most populous of the provinces of oceania he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london nod always been quite like this were there always these vistas of routine nineteenth century houses their sides showed up with faults of timber their windows patchen with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions and the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the for and the willow herb struggled over the heaps of rubble and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung to sordid colonies of warren dwellings like chicken houses but it was bo use he could not remember nothing adjoined of his childhood except a series of bright lit bordeaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible the ministry of truth minimize in newsweek was startlingly different from any other object in sight it was in enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete soaring up terrace after terrace meters into the air from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its white have in elegant lettering the three slogans of the party war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength the ministry ot truth contained it was said three thousand rooms above ground level and corresponding ramifications below scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size so completely did that dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could woe all your of them simultaneously they were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus or government was divided the ministry of truth which concerned itself with news entertainment education and the fine arts the ministry of peace which concerned itself high war the ministry of love which maintained law and order and the ministry of plenty which was responsible for economic affairs their names in newsreel minimize minimal minimum and nineteenth the ministry of love was the really frightening one there were no windows in it at all winston had never been inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometer of it it was a place impossible to enter except on official business and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed wire entrepreneurs steel doors and hidden machine gun nests even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by podolia faced guards in black uniforms armed with pointed transcends winston turned round abruptly he had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescoped he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen be leaving the ministry at this time of day ne had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow s breakfast he took down from the shelf a bottle of relentless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin it have off a sickly oily skill sd of chinese widespread winston poured our nearly a beautiful served himself for a above one gulped it down like a rise of medicine instantly his face turned scarlet and the water run out of his does the stuff was like within acid she moreover in swallowing it one had the sensation of being her on the back of the head with a rubber club the next moment however the burning in his badly died down and the world began to look were cheerful he took a cigarette from a crumpled jacket marked victory cigarettes and victoriously self it upright whereupon the tobacco fell out of to the floor with the next he was more successful he went back to the living room and set down at a small table that store to the left ot the telescoped from the gable drawer he took out a penniless a bottle of ink and a think quarts sizes blank book with a red back and z marbles cover for some reason the telescoped in the living room was in an unusual position instead of bring placed as was normal in the end wall where it souls command the whole room it was in the longer wall opposite the window to one side of it there was a shallow alcorn in which winston was now sitting and which when the fists were built had probably been intended to hold bookshelves by sitting in the alcorn and keeping help back winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescoped so far as sight went he could be heard of course but so long as he stayed in his present position he could hot he seen it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to his the think that he was new about to do but it had also been suggested be one book that he had juet taken out of the drawer it was a peculiarly beautiful book its smooth creamy paper a little yellowed by age was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past he doyle guess however that the book was much older than that he had seen in lying in the window of a frowzy little junk shop in a clumsy quarter of the town just what quarter he did not now remember and had been stricken immediately by in overwhelming desire to possess it party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops dealing of the free market in was called but the ever was not strictly kept because three were various things such as shoelaces and razor blades which it was impossible to get hold of in and other way he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose he had carried it daintily home in his briefcase even with nothing written in it it was a compromising possession the thing that he was about go do was to open a diary this was jot illegal nothing was illegal since third were no longer any laws but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death or wt least by twenty five years in a forced labour camp winston fitted s nip into the pensioner and sucked it to get the grease off the men isa in archaic instrument seldom used even for signatures and he had procured one furtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful sesame paper deserved to be written on with a real nip instead of being scratched with an inc pencil actually he was not used to writing by hand apart from very short notes it was usual ro dictate everything into the electorate which was of course impossible for his present purpose he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for juet a second a tremor had gone through his bowels to mary the paper was the decisive act in small clumsy letters he armor peril th he sat back a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him to begin with he did not know with and certainty that this was it must be round about that date since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty nine and he besieged that he had been both in of gut it was never possible nowadays to pip down any date within a year or two for whom it suddenly occurred to his to winded was he writing this diary for the future for the unborn his mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date of the page and then reached up with a bump against the reappear word doublestage for the first time the magnitude of what is had undertaken came home to him how could you communicate with the future it was of its nature impossible either the future would resemble the present in which face it would not listen to him or it would be different from it and his predicament would is meaningless for some time he sat gazing stupidly it the paper the telescoped had changes over to striding military music it was curious that he seemed not merely to have most the power of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what in was that he had originally intended to say for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossed yes miss that anything would be needed except courage the actual writing would be easy all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally for gears at this moment however even the monologue had dried up moreover his variable ulcer had begun itching unbearably he dared not scratch it because if he did so it always became inflamed the seconds were ticking by he was conscious of nothing except the blackness of the page in front of him the itching of the skin above his angle the blaring of the music and a slight looseness caused by the gin suddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full shops awful th last night to the flicks all was firms one very good ond of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean audience much amused be shots of a great huge fat kan trying to swim away with a helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing along in the water like z surprise then you saw him through the filibusters gunfights they be was dull of holes abo the sea found him turned pick and he sang as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter when hr sank then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it there was a middle aged woman might have been a jewels sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman cutting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself all the time covering him up as made as possible as in she thought her arms could knew the bullets off him then the helicopter planted q hilo bomb ij among them terrific flash and the boat went all to patchwork they there was a wonderful roof of a child s arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its base must have followed in up and there was a lot of applause from the large seats but a woman down on the prove part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they giant lighter if showed it jot in front of kids they giant it aunt right not in front of kids it pint until the police turned her turned her lie i done suppose anything happened ro her nobody carry what the proves say typical whole reaction they never winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp he did hot know what had made him pope out this stream of rubbish but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where be almost felt equal to writing it down it was he now realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today it had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be said to happen it was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winston worked they were dragging the cities out of the crouched and gripping they in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescoped in preparation for the top minutes have winston was must taking six place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight gut had never spoken to cake unexpectedly unto the room one of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors he did not know her name but he knew that she looked in the fiction department presumably since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanned she had some mechanical job on one of the hovel writing machines she was a bold looking girl of about twenty seven with thick hair a freckled face aux shift athletic movements a narrow scarlet sash smoked of the junior anti sex league was wound several times round the waist of her overalls just tightly enough to being out the saintliness of ger hips winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her he knew the reason it was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields and cold gates and community hikes and general clean wilderness which she managed to carry about with her he disliked nearly all women and especially the young wed pretty ones it was always the woman amy above all the young ones who were the most bigoted adherents of the party the swallowing of slogans tar amateur spies and losers out of antithyroid bug this particular girl have him the impression of being more dangerous than most once when they passed in the corridor she give him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled hum with black terror the idea had even crossed his mind that she might is an agent of the thought police that it was time was very unlikely still he continued to feel s peculiar uneasiness which bad fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere near him the other person was a man named o brian a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remove that winston had only a dim idea of its nature a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an other party member approaching o brien wed a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face in spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner he had a trick of resettling his spectacles in his hose which was furiously disarming im some indefinable way curiously civilized it was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled in eighteenth century nobleman offering his sniffing winston had seen o brien perhaps a dozen times ij almost as many years he felt deeply death to him and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o brien s urbana manner and his prize fighter s physique much more it was because of a secretly held belief or perhaps hot even a belief merely a hope that o brien s political orthodoxy was not perfect something in his face suggested it irresistibly and again perhaps it was not even amorphously that was written in his fade hut simply intelligence bit at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telefunken and get him alone winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess indeed there wax no way of doing so as this moment o brien glanced at his wrist watch day that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes have was over he took a chair in the same raw as winston a couple of places away a small dandy hatred woman who worked in the next cubists to winston was between them the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind the next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the big telescoped at the end of the room it was w noise that set one d teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back ot one s neck the hate had started as usual the face of emmanuel goldsmith the enemy of the people had flashed on to the screen there were wishes here and there among the audience the little sandy hatred woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust weinstein was the delegate and tacksolder who once long ago how long ago nobody quite remembered had been one of the leading figures of the party almost of a level with big brother himself and then had engaged in counter revolutionary activities had neon condemned ti death and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared the programmes of the two minutes hate varied from day to day but there was none in which weinstein was not the principal figure he was the primal traitor the earliest defined of the party s purity all subsequent crimes against the party all treacheries acts of sabotage remedies deviations spring directly out of his teaching somewhere or other je was still alive and hatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under the protection of his foreign laysisters perhaps even so it was occasionally ruptured in some hiding place un oceania itself winston s diaphragm was constricted he could never see the face of weinstein without a painful mixture of emotions in was s lead jewish face with a great fuzzy purpose of white hair and a small gotten beard a clever face and yet somehow inherently hospitable with a kind of senile stillness in the long this nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched it resembled the face of a sheep and the voice too had a sheep like quality boatswain was delivering his usual visitors attack upon the doctrines of the party an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have aren able to see through it and get just plausible enough to fill one with an assumed feeling that other people less level headed than oneself might be taken in by it he was amusing big brother he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of place with eugenia he was advocating freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying historically that the revolution had been betrayed and all this in rapid monosyllable speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the party and even contained newsweek words more newsweek words indeed than any party member would normally use in real life and all the while leet one should be in any doubt as to the reality which weinstein s specious chapters covered behind his head on the indiscreet there marched the endless columns of the eurasian army tow after row of solid looking men with expressionless asiatic faces who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar the full rhythmic cramp of the soldiers boots forced the background ro goldwater s bleating voice before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room the show satisfied sleep like face on the screen and the terrifying power of due eurasian army behind it were too much ll be borne besides the angst or even the thought of weinstein produced fear and anger automatically he was an object of hatred more constant than either erratic or fantasia since when oceania was at sir with one of these powers it was generally at place with the other but what was strange was that although weinstein was hated and despised by everybody although every day and a thousand finds a day of platforms on the telescoped ij newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashed ridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this his influence never seemed to grow less always there were fresh cubes waiting to be seduced bg him a day never passed when spies and jobstears acting under his directions were not unmarked by the thought police he was the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state the brotherhood its name was supposed to be there were also whispered stories of a terrible hook a compendium of all the heretics of which thorstein was the author and which circulated interestingly hers and there it qua a book without a title people referred go it if at all simply as the took but one knew of such things only through vague removes neither the brotherhood nor the bulk was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a was of avoiding it in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy people were leaving up and down in their places and shooting wt the tops of their voices on an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen the little sandy handed woman had turned bright pink and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish even o brien s heavy face was flashed he was sitting very straight in his chair his powerful chest dwelling and quivering as though go were standing up to the assault of a wave the dark hatred girl behind winston had begun crying out seize swing swing and suddenly she picked up a heavy newsweek dictionary and flung it at the screen it struck weinstein s nose and bounced off the voice continued inexorably in a lucid moment winston found thar he was shouting with the others and judging his heel violently against the rung of his chair the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not gear one was obliged to act a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoid joining in within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary a hodgkin ecstasy of fear and discursiveness q desire to kill to torture to death faces in with a sludge hammer peeked to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even against one s will into a replacing screaming lunatic and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract undetected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blockade thus at one moment winston s hatred was not turned against thorstein st all but on the contrary against big brother the party and mud thought police and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely decided homeric on the screen sold guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies are get the very next instant he was at one with the people about him and all that was said of goldsmith seemed to his to be true as those moments his sextet loathing of big brother changed into avocation and big brother seemed to tower up an invincible fearless projector standing like a rock against the forces of asia and weinstein in spite of his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hung about his very existence seemed like some sinister enchanted capable by the more power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization it was even possible at moments to switch one s gained this way or that by a voluntary act suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which obe wrenches one s head stay from the willow in a nightmare winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark hatred girl behind him vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind he would flag had to death with a rubber tradition he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her vtol ot arrows like saint selection he would radish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax better than before moreover he realized why it was that he hated her he hated her because she was young and pretty and success because hr wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so because round her sweet supply waist which seemed to ask you ti encircle it with your arm there was only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity the hate rose to its climax the voice of weinstein had become an actual sheep s bleat and for an instant the fade changes onto that of a sheep then the shall face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing huge and terrible his sub machine gun roaring and seeming ro spring out of the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row actually clinched backyards in their seats but in the same moment drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure tested unto the face of bib brother black hatred black montrachet d full of power and mysterious calm and so vast that in almost filled up the screen nobody heard what big brother was saying it was merely a few words of encouragement the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken than the face of big brother faded away again and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bill capitals war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength but the fans of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it had made on everyone s eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately the little handcovered woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front ot had with a credulous murmur that sounded like my saviour she extended her arms towards the screen then she buried her face in her hands it was apparent that she was uttering a player at this moment the entire group if people broke into a deep slow rhythmical ching of b b b b over and over again very slowly with a long pause between the first b and the second a heavy murderous sound somehow curiously savage in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp or naked felt and the throbbing of tom tons for perhaps as much ss thirty seconds they kept it up it was a refrain that was often heard un moments of overwhelming emotion partly it wax a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it was an act of self hypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise winston x extremes seemed ro grew cold in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium but this sub human charting of b b b b always filled him with horror of course ye chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwise to listeners your feelings to control your face to do what everyone else was reins was an instinctive reaction but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed jim and it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened in indeed it did happen momentarily he caught o brien s eye o brown had stood up he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his mose with his characteristic gesture but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met and for ax long as it took to happen winston knew yes ge knew that o brien was thinking the same thing as himself an unmistakable message had passed in was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes i am with you o brown seemed to be saying to hum i know precisely that you are feeling i know all about your contempt yoke hatred your disgust but don t worry i am on your side and then the flash of intelligence was gone and o brisk s face was we inscrutable as everybody else s that was all and he was already uncertain whether it had happened such incidents never had any sequel all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party perhaps the tumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all perhaps the brotherhood really existed it was impossible in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions to is sure that tow brotherhood was not simply a myth some days hr believed un it some days not there sis no evidence only fleeting glimpses that might away anything or nothing snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbled on lavatory walls once even when two strangers met a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it night ne a signal of recognition it was all housework very likely he hex imagined everything he had gone back to gas article without looking at o brief again the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind it would have been inconceivable dangerous even of he had known how to set about doing it for a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the did of the story but even that was a memorable event un the locked loneliness ij which one had go live winston roused himself and set up straighten he let out a veldt the gin wax rising from his stomach his eyes re focused on the page he discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing as though be automatic action and it was no longer the same crawled awkward handwriting as before his pen had slid continuously over the smiled paper printing in large neat capitals down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again filling half a page he could not help feeling a twinge of panic it was absurd since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary but fee a moment he was tempted ro rear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether he did not do so however because he knew that it was useless whether he wrote down with big brother or whether he refrained from writing it jade no difference whether he went on with the diary or whether he did not to on with it made no difference the thought police would get him just the same he had committee would still have committed even if he had never set men to paper the essential crime that contained all others in itself thoughtfully they called it thoughtfully was not a thing that could be concealed for ever you might dodge successfully for a while even for years but sooner or later they were bound to guy you it was always as night the arrests invariably happened at night the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough bank shaking your shoulder the lights glaring in your eyes the ring of hard faces found the bed in the vast majority of cases there was no trial no report of the arrest people simply disappeared always during the night your name was removed from the registers every record of everything you had ever done six wiped out your one time existence was denied and then forgotten you were abolished anticipated memorized was the usual word for a moment he was seized by a bond of hysteria he began writing in a hurried untidy sprawl thrill shoot me i long care theory shoot me in the back of the neck o dost care doan with big brother they always short you in the back of the neck i dust carr down high big brother he sat back on had chair slightly ashamed of himself she lake down the pen the next moment he started violently there was a knocking at the door already he sat aa still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt but no the knocking was repeated the worst thing of all would be to delay his heart was thumping like a drum but his race from long habit was probably expressionless he got up and moved heavily towards the door
