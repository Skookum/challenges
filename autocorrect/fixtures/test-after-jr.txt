chapter it was a bright good day in peril and tnt clocks were striking thirteen winston smith his chin nuzzled onto his breast in an effort to escape the file wind slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions though hot quickly enough to present a swirl of gritty must from entering along with him the hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rat mats at one and of ot z coloured poster too large foe indoor display had bryn tacked to the wall it depicted simply an enormous fact side than a metre wide the face of a man of about force five with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features winston jade for the stairs it was no use trying the lift even af the best of times it was seldom working and qt present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours it was part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week the flat was seven flights up and winston who was thirty nine and had a variable ulcer above his right ankle went slowly resting several times on the may on each landing opposite the lift short the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall it was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move big brother is watching you the caution beneath in ran inside the flat w fruits voice was reading out a list of figures shish had something to do with the production of pig iron the voice same from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right hand wall winston turned a switch and the voice bank somewhat though the words were still distinguishable the instrument the grassgreen it was called could be rimmed buy there was no way of shutting it off completely he moved over to the window a smallish trail figure the remoteness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party his hair was very fair his face naturally language his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cops if the winter that had must based outside even through the shut window pane the world looked cold down in the street little eddies of wine were whirling must and tote paper onto spirits and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue there seemed to be no colors im anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere the exschoolteacher d face gazed down from every commanding corner there was one on the house front immediately opposite big brother is watching you the caution said whole the dark eyes looked deep into winston s own down at streetlight another posted torn at one corner flapped fitfully in the with alternately covering and recovering the single word indoor in the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs hovered for an instant like a bluecollar and patted away again with a curbing fought it was the police patrol snooping into people s windows the patrols did not marmee however only the thought police mattered behind winston s back the voice from the telescoped was still bubbling away about pay iron and the selfsufficient of the lunch three year plan the telescoped received and transmitted simultaneously and sound that winston made above the level of a very law whisper would be picked up be it moreover so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded he could be seen as well ad heard there was of course no way of growing whether you were being watched as any given moment how often or on what system the thought police plugged in on any individual wore was fieldwork it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time but at any date they could plug in time wire whenever they wanted to you had ro live did tube from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized winston kept his back turned to the telescoped it was safer though as ne well knew over a back can be revealing a kilometer away the ministry of truth his place pt work lowered vast and white above the grimm landscape this he thought with a sort ot vague distaste this was london chief city of airstrip one itself the third most populous of the provinces of oceania he tried to squeeze out time childhood memory thar should tell him whether london had always been quite like this were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth century houses their sides showed up with haupts of timber fewer windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions and the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the are and the willow herb straggled over the helps of bubble and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch wed there has spring to sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken houses but it was mo use he would not remember nothing remained of his childhood except s series of bright lit tabletop occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible the ministry of truth minstrel in newsweek was startlingly different from any other object im might it was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering short concrete roaring up terrace after terrace metier into the are from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its where face in elegant decreeing the three slogans of the party war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength mud ministry of truth contained it was said three thousand rooms above ground level and corresponding ramifications below scattered about london there were must three other buildings of similar appearance and size so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could she all four of them simultaneously thet were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided the ministry of truth which concerned itself with news entertainment education and the five arts the ministry of peace which concerned itself with ear the ministry of love shock maintained law and order and the ministry of plenty which was responsible for economic affairs their nairo in newsweek minstrel minimal minimum and manipulate the ministry of love was the really frightening one there were no windows in it at all winston had never been inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometer of it it was a place impossible to enter except on official business and then only by penetration through a maze of barbed wire announcements dared doors and hidden machine gun nests even the streets leading up ti its outer barriers were roamed by monilia faced guards in black uniforms armed with pointed traditions winston turned round abruptly he had her his features into eye expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable ro wear when facing the television he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except q hunk of dark coloured break which had got to be saved for tomorrow s breakfast he took down from for shelf a bottle of sojourners liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin it gave off a sickly oily smell as of chinese diagnostic winston poured out nearly q beautiful served himself for a stock and gulped it down like a dose of medicine instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes the stuff was like within acid and moreover in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club ted next moment however the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look note cheerful he took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked victory cigarettes and victoriously held it upright whereupon the tobacco felt lit on to the floor with the next he was more successful he went nail to the living room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescoped from the table drawer he took out a gunpowder a bottle of ink and a thick quarts sized blank upon with a red back and a marbles cover for some reason the telescoped in the living doom was in an unusual position instead of being placed as was normal in the end walk three if could command the whole room it was in the longer wall opposite the window to one side of it there was a shallow alcorn in which winston was now sitting and which when the flats were built had probably been intended to hood bookshelves bg sitting in the alcorn and keeping well back winston was like to remain outside the range in the telescoped so far as might went he could be heard of course but so long as he stayed im his present position he could not be seen it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was new about go do but in had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer it was a peculiarly beautiful book its smooth creamy paper a little yellowed it age was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least fatty years past he could bless however thar the book was much older than that he had seen it lying in the window of a frowzy little junk shop in a clumsy quarter of the town that what quarter he did not now remember and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess or party members were supposed not go go into ordinary shops dealing on the free market it was called but the rule was not strictly kept because there were various things such as shoelaces and razor blades which in was impossible to get hold of in and order way hr had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two compare fifty at the time he was not conscious of wanting in for abo particular purpose he had carried it building home in his briefcase even with nothing written in it it was a compromising possession the thing that he was about to do was to knew a diary thea was not illegal nothing was illegal since there were jo longer any laws but if detected it was reasonably certain that it sould be punished by death or at least by twenty five yeard in a forced labour many winston fitted a nip into the performer and sucked it to get the grease off the pah was an archaic instrument seldom used even for signatures and is had produced one furtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful dreamy paper observed to ve written on sigh a real nip instead of being scratched with an ink pencil actually he was not used to writing by hand apart from bury short jones it was usual to dictate everything into the spencerian which was of course impossible for his present purpose he dipped the per into the ink and then filtered for just a second a tremor had gone through his bowels to mark the paper was the decisive act in small clumsy letters he wrote peril th he set back a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him to begin with he did not know with any certainty that this was it just be round shift that date since ye was fairly sure that his age was theory none and he believes that he had been born in or but it was never possible nowadays to lie down any date within a year or two for whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this diary for the future for the unborn hid mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page and then ketches up with a bump against the newsweek word bootlegging for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home ro his how could flu communicate with the future it was if its nature impossible either the future would resemble the present in which case it would mot listen to him or it would be different from it and his predicament would be meaningless for some time he set gazing stupidly at the paper the grassgreen had changed over to striding military music it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what in was that he bad originally intended to say for weeks past he had sewn making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage the actual writing would be easy all he had to to was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally for years as that moment however even the monologue bad tried up moreover his variable ulcer had begun itching unbearably he dated not scratch it because in he did so it always became inflamed the seconds were ticking by he was conscious of nothing except the blackness of the page in front of gin the itching of the skin above his ankle the blaring of the music and a slight looseness caused by the gin suddenly he began writing in sheet panic only imperfectly aware of what ye was setting down his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops moral tu last night to the flocks all war films one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat nan trying to swim away with a helicopter after him first you wow him wallowing along in the water like a tortoise then you saw him through the helpfulness gunfights then he was full of holes and the sea round his turned pink and ne sank ax suddenly as though the holes had out in bus water audience shouting with laughter when je sank than his saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it there was a middle aged woman night have bern a crisis sitting up in the big with a little boy about three years old in her arms little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her brewers is if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself all the time covering him up he much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him they the helicopter planted a kill bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to patchwork then there was a wonderful shot of a child d arm found up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the pools last of the hours suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they giant lighter of showed it not in front of kiss they midst it aunt right not in front of kids it aunt until the police turned her turner her out i done suppose anything happened to her moving cases what the proves say typical prove reaction they bevel winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish but the curious going was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down it was he now realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the fears today it had happened that morning af the ministry if anything sp nebulous could be said to happen it was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winston worked they were dragging the chairs out of the vehicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescoped in preparation for the two minutes hate winston was that taking his place in one of the middle road when two people whom he knew by sight nut had never spoken to came unexpectedly into the room one of them was s girl whom be often passed in the corridors he did not know her name but he knew that she soaked in the fiction department presumably since is had sometimes sewn her with oily hands and carrying a spanned she had some mechanical job oh one if the novel writing machines she was q bold looking girl of about twenty seven with thick hair a freckled face and short athletic movements a narrow scarlet each smiled if the junior anti sez league was wound several times round the waist of her overalls just rightly enough to being out the shallowness of her hips winston had disliked her from the gary first moment of seeing her he ends the reason if was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean tenderness which she managed to carry about with her he disliked nearly all woman and especially the young and pretty ones it was always the women and above all the young ones who were the jolt lighter adherents of the party the swallowing of slogans the amateur spies and losses out of amorphously but this particular girl gave his the impression of being more dangerous than most once even they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce eight into him and for a moment bad filled him with black terror the idea had even crossed his kind that she might be an agent of the thought police that in was true was very unlikely still ge continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere near him the other person was a man named o brien a member of hys inner party and holder of some post so important and remove that winston had only a dim idea of its nature a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching o brien was a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal fact in spite or his formidable appearance je had a certain charm of manner he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming in some indefinable may curiously civilized it was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenth century nobleman offering his sniffing winston had seen o brien perhaps a dozen times in almost aa many years he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely because he was intrigues by the contrast between o brief s urbana manner and his prize fighter s physique much more it was because of a secretly held belief or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope that o brown s political orthodoxy was not perfect something in his have suggested it irresistibly and again perhaps it was mor even amorphously that was written in job face but simply intelligence but at any fate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to of somehow you could cheat the telescoped and get him alone winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess indeed there was no way of doing so at this moment o brien glanced at his wrist watch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over he took a chair un the same row as winston a couple of places away a small sandy hatred woman who worked in the next article to winston was between them the girl with dark hair was sifting immediately behind the next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the bug telescoped at the end of the room it was a moise that set ome s teeth of edge and bristled the have at the baci of one s neck the hate had started as usual the face of emmanuel weinstein the enemy if the people had flashed on to the screen there were hosses were and there among the audience the little sarah hatred woman gave z squeak of mingled fear and disgust weinstein was the delegate and tacksolder who once king ago how long ago nobody white remembered had been one of the leading figures of the party almost on a level with big brother himself ads then had engages in counter revolutionary activities had idea condemned to death and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared the programmes of the two minutes hate varied from day to day but there was none in which weinstein was not the principal figure he was the primal traitor the earliest defined of the party s purity all subsequent crimes against the party all treacheries acts of sabotage revenues deviations sprang directly but if his teaching somewhere or other he was still above and hatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under the protection of his foreign laysisters perhaps even so in was occasionally ruptured in some hiding place in oceania itself winston s diaphragm was constricted he doyle never she the face of weinstein without a painful mixture of emotions it was a lean jewish came with a great fuzzy alveoli of white hair and a small gotten beard a clever face and yet somehow inherently hospitable with a kind of senile wellknown in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched it resembled the came of a sheep and the voice too had a sheep like quality weinstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the party in attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people less level headed than oneself might be taken in by it he was amusing big brother he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eugenia he was advocating freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying historically thay the revolution had vest betrayed and all this in rapid monosyllable speech which was a sort of parody ot the habitual style of the orators of the party and even contained newsweek words more newsweek words indeed than any party member would normally use un real life and all the while lest one should he in any doubt as to the reality which goldsmith s specious electric covered behind his head in the telescoped three farther the endless columns of the eurasian army row after row of solid looking men with expressionless asiatic faded who swim up to the surface of the screen wed vanished to he replaced by others exactly similar the duck rhythmic teams ll the soldiers boots formed the background ft weinstein s bleating voice before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage whee breaking out from half the people in the room the self satisfied sheep like face on the screen and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind it were too much to be borne besides the sight or even the thought ot weinstein produced fear amy anger automatically he was an object of hatred more constant than wither eugenia or fantasia since when oceania was wt war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other but they was strange was that although weinstein new hated and despised by everybody although every day and a thousand times a may on platforms on the telescoped in newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashed ridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were im spoke of all this his influence never seemed to grew less always there were fresh dunes waiting to be seduced by him a day never passed when soils and jobstears acting under his directions were not unmarked by the thought police is was the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state the brotherhood its name was supposed ro is there were also whispered stories of a terrible book a compendium of app the stresses of which weinstein was the author and which circulated interestingly here and there it was a book without a title people referred to it if at all simply as the book but one knew of such things only through vague memoirs neither the brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a any of avoiding it in its second minute the hand rose to a frenzy people were leaping up and down ij their placed and shouting at the tops of there voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen the little sandy hatred woman had turned bright pink and her month was opening and shutting like that or a landed fish even o brien s heavy face was flushed he was sitting very straight in his chair his powerful chest dwelling and quivering is though he were standing up to the assault of a wave the dark hatred girl behind winston had begun crying out swine swine swine and suddenly she picked to a heavy newsweek dictionary and flung it as the screen it struck goldsmith s nose and bounced off the voice continued inexorably in a lucid moment winston found that be was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoid joining in within thirty becomes any pretence was always unnecessary a hideous ecstasy of fear and discursiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sludge hammer seemed to flow through the whole group of people like in electric current turning one even against ome s wool into a grumbling screaming lunatic and yet the rage that ome felt was an abstract undetected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blockade thus at one moment winston s hatred was not turned against volunteer at all but oh the contrary against big brother the party and the thought police and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely decided heretic on the agreed sole guardian of truth and sanity ij a world of does and yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him and all that was said of weinstein deemed to him to be true at those moments his secret loathing of big brother changed into avocation and bug brother seemed to power up in invincible fearless projector standing like a rock against tar hordes of asia and weinstein in spite of his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hung about his very existence seemed like some sinister enchanted capable by the were power of big voice of wrecking the structure of civilization it was even possible at moments to switch obe s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act suddenly by the sort of violent report with which one wretched one s head away from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the five on the screen to the dark hatred girl behind him vivid beautiful hallucinations flatbed through his kind he would flog her to death with a rubber trenchant he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrive like saint selection is would radish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax better than before moreover ye realized why in was that be hated her he hated her because one was flung and pretty and sinless because he wanted ti go to bed with her and would never do so because round her sweet supply waist which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm there was only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity the have road to its climax the voice of weinstein had become an withal sheep s clear and for in instant the face changed into that of a sheep then the wheel face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who peeked to be advancing huge and terrible his sun machine him roaring and seeming to spring out if the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row actually clinched backwards in their seats but in the dome moment drawing q deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into the face of big brother black hatred place konstantin d full of power and mysterious calm and so fast that in almost filled up the screen nobody heard when big brother was saying in was modern z few words of encouragement the work of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken then the face of big brother faded zeal again and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bold capitals war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it had made in everyone s eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately the little handicapped woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of hee with a credulous murmur that sounded like my saviour she extended her whiz towards the screen then she buried her wacs in her hands it was apparent that due was uttering a prayer at this moment the entire group mg people books into a deep slow rhythmical chant of b b b b over and over again very slowly with a long raise between the first b and the second a heavy survivors sound someone curiously savage ij the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of makes feet and the throbbing of tom tons for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept in up it was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother big still more it was an act of self hypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise winston s entrance seemed to grow cold in the two minutes hand he could jot help sharing in the general delirium but this due human chanting of b b b b always filled him with horror of course he changed with the rest in was impossible to do otherwise to desirable your feelings to control your face to do that everyone else was doing was an instinctive reaction but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him and it was exactly at thea moment that the signigicant think happened of indeed it did happen momentarily he caught o brien s eye o bride had stood up he had taken off his spectators and was in the act of developing them on hid nose with his characteristic gesture but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met and for as long as in took to happen winston know yes he knew flat o brien was thinking age same thing as himself an unmistakable message had passed it was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes i am with you o brien seemed to be saying to him i know precisely what you are feeling i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust but don t worry i so in your side and then the flash of intelligence was gone and o brown s face was as inscrutable as everybody else s that was all and hr was already uncertain whether it had happened such incidents never had any sequel all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party perhaps the tumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all perhaps the brotherhood really existed in was impossible in spire of the express arrests and confessions and executives to ve sure that the brotherhood was not simply a myth some days he believed in it some days not there was no evidence only fleeting glimpsed that might mean anything or nothing snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbled on lavatory walls once even when two strangers met a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition it was all fieldwork very likely he had imagined everything he had gone hack ti his debacle without looking at o brien again the idea of following up rheum momentary contact hardly crossed his mind it would have been inconceivable dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it for a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the end ot the story but even that was z memorable event in the locked loneliness in which one had to love winston roused himself and sat up straighten he let out z belch the gin was rising from his stomach his eyes re focused on the page he discovered that while be sat helplessly musing he had also been writing as though by automatic action and it was no longer the same clamped awkward handwriting as before his men had slid continuously over the smooth paper printing in large beat capitals down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and kqed again filling half a page he could not help feeling a twinge of panic it was absurd since the writing of their particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether he did not do so however because be knew that it was useless whether he wrote down with big brother or whether hr refrained from writing it made no difference whether he went on with the diary or whether he did nor to on hugh or made no difference the thought police would get him just the same he had committed would stoll have committee down if he had never set pen to paper the essential crime that contained all others in itself thoughtfully they called it thoughtfully was not a thing that would be concealed for ever you might drive successfully for w whole earn for years but sooner or later they were bound to get you it was always it night the arrests invariably happened at night the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lights glaring in your eyes the ring of hard faces round the bed in the vast majority of cases there was no trial no report of the arrest people simply disappeared always dating the night your name was removed from the registers every record of everything you bad even done was wiped out most one time existence was denied and then forgotten you were abolished anticipated memorized was the usual word for a moment he was seized by z kind of hysteria he began writing on a carried untidy sprawl thrill shoot mr i done care thrill shoot me in the back of the neck i done care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i cost fare down with big brother he sat back in hid chair slightly ashamed of himself and paid down the pen the next moment he statues violently there was a knocking at the door already he sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt but ml the knocking was repeated the worse tying of all would be to delay his heart was thumping like a drum but his face from loaf habit was probably expressionless he got up and moved heavily towards the door
